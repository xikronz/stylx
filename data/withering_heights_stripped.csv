"I have just returned from a visit to my landlord, that lonely neighbor with whom I am going to get into trouble. It really is a beautiful country! I don't think I could have found a place in England so far removed from the social turmoil. A paradise for a consummate misanthrope: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are an ideal couple to share this desolation."
"A wonderful man! He had no idea how deeply I had been touched by his presence when I saw his dark eyes retract so suspiciously under his brows at my approach, and his fingers, with jealous determination, dig still deeper into his waistcoat when I called him. ""Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked. A nod was the reply. Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, I do myself the honor of calling on you as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not disturbed you by my insistence on applying to occupy Thrushcross Grange. I heard yesterday that you were considering it. ""Thrushcross Grange is mine, sir,"" he interrupted, wincing. ""I would not allow anyone to disturb me if I could avoid it. Come in!"" This ""come in"" was spoken between clenched teeth and expressed the thought, ""Go to hell!"" ""Even the gate over which he was leaning showed no sign of sympathy at these words; and I think it was this circumstance which made me accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed even more reserved than I."
"Seeing that my horse's breast was almost over the gate, he put out his hand to untie it, then preceded me sullenly down the causeway, calling out as soon as we entered the yard, ""Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse and bring some wine."" ""We have the whole household here, I suppose,"" thought this convoluted order. ""No wonder the grass grows between the stones and the cows are the only ones to trim the hedges."" Joseph was an old man, no, an old one: very old perhaps, but vigorous and vigorous. ""The Lord help us!"" he murmured in a tone of sullen displeasure as he took my horse from me. Meanwhile, he looked at me with such bitterness that, out of kindness, I suspected he needed divine help to digest his dinner, and his pious exclamation had no relation to my unexpected arrival. Wuthering Heights is the residence of Mr. Heathcliff. 'Wuthering' is a significant provincial adjective describing the atmospheric turbulence to which the place is subject in stormy weather. A clean and refreshing ventilation must be constantly provided above: the force of the north wind blowing overboard is indicated by the excessive leaning of some stunted fir trees at the back of the house; and by a row of thin thorns, all stretching their branches in the same direction, as if imploring the sun's alms."
"Fortunately, the architect had the foresight to build a sturdy house: the narrow windows are set deep in the wall, and the corners are protected by broad projecting stones. Before crossing the threshold, I paused to admire the abundance of grotesque carvings that dotted the facade, especially around the main entrance; above, amid a jungle of decrepit griffins and cheeky little boys, I spotted the date '1500' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw'. I wanted to make a few comments and ask the surly-tempered owner for a brief history of the property; but his attitude at the door seemed to demand my quick entry or complete departure, and I did not want to arouse his impatience before inspecting the penetrarium. A halt brought us to the family parlor, devoid of any vestibule or entrance corridor: it is here called 'home' par excellence."
"It generally comprises the kitchen and the parlor; but I believe the kitchen at Wuthering Heights is obliged to retire into another room entirely: at least, I heard a clatter of tongues and a clatter of cooking utensils at the back; and I saw no sign of roasting, boiling, or baking around the immense fireplace; nor the slightest gleam of copper pots and pewter jugs on the walls. One side, indeed, reflected beautifully the light and heat from immense rows of pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, rising row upon row on an immense oak chest of drawers, reaching to the ceiling. This last had never been signed: its whole anatomy was revealed to the inquiring eye, except where a wooden frame laden with oatcakes and bundles of beef, mutton, and legs of ham concealed it."
"Above the fireplace stood several grim-looking old rifles and a few horse pistols, and, for decoration, three colored tin cans lined the wall. The floor was of smooth white stone; the chairs, with their high backs and primitive shapes, were painted green; one or two heavy black chairs stood in the shadows. In an archway beneath the chest of drawers lay an enormous liver-colored female dog, surrounded by a flock of howling puppies; and other dogs haunted other alcoves."
"The apartment and furnishings were nothing special compared to those of a simple northern farmer, with his stubborn air and sturdy limbs, clearly visible in his breeches and leggings. Such a man, sitting in his armchair, his mug of foaming ale on the round table before him, might be seen anywhere in these hills if one happened to visit at the right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff presents a striking contrast to his home and way of life."
"He is a dark-skinned gypsy, a gentleman in dress and manner, that is to say, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: perhaps a little unkempt, but with his carelessness, he does not look bad, for he has a straight and elegant figure; and rather dark. Some might suspect him of a certain underdeveloped pride; I have a hunch that this is not at all the case: I know instinctively that his reserve springs from an aversion to ostentatious displays of feeling, to expressions of reciprocal kindness. He will secretly love as much as he hates, and will consider it a form of impudence to be loved or hated in return."
"No, I'm going too fast: I'm giving him too much credit for my own good qualities. Mr. Heathcliff may have reasons quite different from those which motivate me to restrain myself when meeting a potential acquaintance. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother always told me I would never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved that I was absolutely incapable of it."
"While enjoying the fine weather on the coast for a month, I found myself in the company of a truly fascinating being: a veritable goddess in my eyes, as long as she paid me no attention. I never “spoke my love aloud”; yet, if looks had a language, even the smallest idiot would have guessed that I was in over my head: she finally understood me and looked at me—the sweetest look imaginable. And what did I do? I confess it with shame: I shrank, frozen, like a snail; with every glance, I felt colder and colder; until finally, the poor innocent woman began to doubt her own sanity and, overcome by her supposed mistake, persuaded her mother to leave."
"This curious turn of events has earned me a reputation for deliberate cruelty; how unjustified it was, only I can see. I sat down at the end of the hearth, opposite the one my owner was approaching, and took advantage of a moment's silence to attempt to stroke the dog, which had left its nursery and was prowling like a wolf towards the back of my legs, lip curled and white teeth bared. My caress brought out a long, guttural growl. ""Leave the dog alone,"" growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, quelling his outbursts with a kick. ""She is not used to being petted, nor to being kept like a pet."" Then, going to a side door, he called again, ""Joseph!"" "" Joseph murmured indistinctly from the depths of the cellar, but made no move to come up; Then his master sprang upon him, leaving me to face the ferocious female dog and two grim, shaggy sheepdogs, who shared with her a jealous watch over my every move."
"Having no intention of making contact with their fangs, I sat silently; but, thinking they would find it difficult to understand silent insults, I unfortunately yielded to winks and grimaces addressed to the trio. An aberration in my features so irritated Madame that she burst into a rage and jumped onto my knee. I threw her back and hastened to push the table between us. This action threw the whole group into a frenzy: half a dozen four-legged demons, of various sizes and ages, sprang out of hidden caves in the common center."
"I felt my heels and tails like strange targets for attack; and while I fended off the more imposing combatants as best I could with the poker, I felt obliged to loudly implore some of the housemates for help in restoring peace. Mr. Heathcliff and his servant mounted the cellar stairs with an embarrassing drool: I don't think they moved a second faster than usual, though the fireplace was a perfect storm of moans and grunts. Fortunately, an inhabitant of the kitchen was more hasty: a voluptuous lady, with tucked-up dress, bare arms, and flushed cheeks, burst in between us, brandishing a frying pan. She used this weapon, and her tongue, with such determination that the storm abated as if by magic, and she was left alone, tossed like a sea in a violent wind, when her master arrived. ""What the devil is going on?"" he asked, looking at me with a look I could hardly bear after this inhospitable treatment. ""What the devil, really!"" I murmured. ""That herd of possessed pigs couldn't have had a worse mind than yours, sir."""
"'Might as well leave a stranger with a pack of tigers!' 'They don't bother with people who don't touch anything,' he observed, placing the bottle before me and straightening the table. 'The dogs had better be vigilant. A glass of wine?' 'No, thank you.' 'Not bitten, eh?' 'If I had been, I'd have put my seal on the biter.' Heathcliff's face relaxed into a smile. 'Now, now,' he said, 'you're excited, Mr. Lockwood. Here, have a little wine.'"
"Guests are so rare in this house that my dogs and I, I freely confess, hardly know how to receive them. ""To your health, sir?"" I bowed and returned my promise. I began to realize that it would be foolish to sulk over the unseemly behavior of a pack of stray dogs. Besides, I was hardly inclined to grant this man any further entertainment at my expense, his temper having taken this turn. He—probably influenced by a cautious reflection on the folly of insulting a good tenant—relaxed a little in his laconic style of truncating his pronouns and auxiliaries, and introduced what he thought would be a topic of interest to me: a treatise on the advantages and disadvantages of my present lodgings."
"I found him very intelligent on the topics discussed; and before I left, I was encouraged to come back tomorrow. He obviously didn't want me to come back. I'm going anyway."
"It's amazing how sociable I feel compared to him. Yesterday afternoon was cold and foggy. I almost wanted to spend my afternoon by the fire in my study, rather than wading through heather and mud to Wuthering Heights."
"However, when I got up after dinner (NB: I dine between twelve and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a lady-in-waiting, considered a regular at the house, could not or would not understand my request to be served at five o'clock), when, with this nonchalant intention, I mounted the stairs and entered the room, I saw a maid on her knees, surrounded by brooms and coal bins, raising an infernal cloud of dust by smothering the flames with piles of embers. This sight immediately revolted me; I took my hat, and after a four-mile walk, I arrived at the gate of Heathcliff's garden, just in time to escape the first flakes of a snowstorm. On that bare hill, the earth was hard with black frost, and the air made me shiver all over."
"Unable to unfasten the chain, I jumped over it and ran up the cobbled embankment, lined with gooseberry bushes. I knocked in vain for permission to enter, until my joints tingled and the dogs howled. “Filthy inhabitants!” I cried to myself. “You deserve eternal isolation for your gross inhospitality. At least I wouldn’t leave my doors locked during the day. No matter, I’ll get in!” Determined, I grabbed the latch and shook it vigorously."
"Joseph, looking winey, poked his head out of a round window in the barn. ""What are you for?"" he called. ""The teacher is downstairs. Go through the door if you want to speak to him."" ""Is there no one to open it?"" I answered. ""There is no one, except the teacher; she refuses to open it, and you'll make your filthy racket until you have to."" ""Why? You can't tell her who I am, can you, Joseph?"" ""Me neither! I don't want to,"" murmured the head as it disappeared. The snow was getting deep."
"I grasped the latch to try again; a young man, coatless and holding a pitchfork, then appeared in the courtyard behind me. He beckoned me to follow him, and after passing through a wash-house and a paved area containing a coal shed, a pump, and a dovecote, we finally arrived at the immense, warm, and welcoming apartment where I had been received previously. It glowed delightfully in the light of a huge fire, made of embers, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a sumptuous dinner, I saw, to my great joy, the ""mistress,"" a person whose existence I had never known."
"I bowed and waited, thinking she would ask me to sit down. She looked at me, leaned back in her chair, and remained motionless and silent. ""Bad weather!"" I remarked. ""I fear, Mrs. Heathcliff, that the door may suffer the consequences of the inconsiderate presence of your servants: I have done all I could to make them hear me."" She remained silent. I stared at her—and at least she kept her eyes fixed on me coldly and carelessly, in a most embarrassing and disagreeable manner. ""Sit down,"" said the young man gruffly. ""He will be here presently."" I obeyed, nodded, and called to wicked Juno, who, during this second conversation, deigned to wag the tip of her tail in recognition. ""A fine animal!"" I resumed. ""Do you intend to part with the little ones, madam?"" ""They are not mine,"" said the kind landlady, in a tone more repugnant than Heathcliff himself could have managed. ""Ah, are your favorites among them?"" I continued, turning to a dark pillow covered with what looked like cats. ""A strange choice of favorites!"" she remarked disdainfully."
"Unfortunately, it was a pile of dead rabbits. I made another detour and approached the fireplace, repeating my remark about the violence of the evening. ""You shouldn't have gone out,"" she said, getting up and taking two painted tin cans from the mantelpiece. She had previously been shielded from the light; now I had a clear view of her whole figure and face."
"She was slim, and seemed scarcely out of her youth: an admirable figure, and the most delicate face I have ever had the pleasure of contemplating; fine, very fair features; blond, or rather golden, curls hanging loosely around her delicate neck; and eyes, if they had held a pleasing expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my sensitive heart, the only feelings they expressed oscillated between contempt and a sort of despair, very unnatural to detect in them. Her glance was almost beyond her reach; I made a gesture to help her; she turned to me as a miser would turn to me if someone attempted to help him count his gold. ""I don't want your help,"" she said sharply; ""I can go and get it myself."" ""Excuse me!"" I hastened to reply. ""Are you invited to tea?"" "" she asked, tying an apron over her crisp black dress and standing over the teapot with a spoon on the tray. ""I'd like a cup of tea,"" I replied. ""Have you been invited?"" she repeated. ""No,"" I said with a half-smile. ""You have to ask me."" She threw back the tea, spoon included, and sat back in her chair like a cat; her brow furrowed and her red lower lip swelling, like a child about to cry. Meanwhile, the young man had wrapped himself in a rather threadbare outer garment and, straightening himself before the flames, looked at me out of the corner of his eye, as if a deadly quarrel were raging between us."
"I began to doubt whether he was a servant: his dress and speech were coarse, devoid of all the superiority characteristic of Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers curled insolently over his cheeks, and his hands were tanned like a common workman's; yet his manner was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of the diligence of a servant to the lady of the house. Having no clear indication of his condition, I thought it best to ignore his strange behavior; and five minutes later, Heathcliff's entrance relieved me somewhat of my uneasiness. ""You see, sir, I came as promised!"" I exclaimed cheerfully; ""and I fear I shall be exposed to the weather for half an hour, if you can shelter me during that time."" ""Half an hour?"" "" he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; I wonder if you should choose the thickest snowstorm to walk in. Do you know you might get lost in the marshes? Those who know these moors often get lost on such nights; and I can tell you there is no chance of change at the moment. ""Perhaps I could find a guide among your boys, who could stay at the Grange until tomorrow. Could you provide me with one?"" ""No, I can't."" ""Oh, really! Well, then I must trust to my wits."" ""Phew!"" ""Are you going to make tea?"" he asked the shabby coat, turning his fierce gaze from me to the young woman. ""Is he going to have tea too?"" she asked, imploring Heathcliff. ""Make it, will you?"" was his reply, so abrupt that I started."
"The tone of his voice betrayed real malice. I no longer felt the need to call Heathcliff a great man. Once the preparations were complete, he invited me: ""Now, sir, move your chair forward."" And all of us, including the uncouth young man, gathered around the table: a severe silence reigned as we discussed our meal."
"I thought that if I had caused this cloud, it was my duty to try to dispel it. They could not remain so gloomy and silent every day; and it was impossible, however gloomy they might be, that their general frown should be their daily expression. 'It is strange,' I began between cups of tea, 'it is strange how habit can mould our tastes and ideas: many would not imagine happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as yours, Mr. Heathcliff; yet I dare say, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable wife as the ruling spirit of your hearth and heart—' 'My amiable wife!' he interrupted with a smile almost evil. 'Where is she, my amiable wife?' 'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.' » “Well… oh, one might suggest that his spirit took on the role of a guardian angel, watching over the fate of Wuthering Heights even after his body disappeared. Is that right?” I felt I had made a mistake and tried to correct it."
I should have noticed that the age difference between the two was too great to make it likely that they were a man and a woman. One was in his forties: a period of mental fortitude when men rarely entertain the illusion of having married a woman for love; we reserve that fantasy for the comfort of our later years. The other didn't look seventeen.
"Then a thought occurred to me: 'The clown next to me, drinking his tea from a bowl and eating his wife without washing his hands, could be her husband: Heathcliff Jr., of course. That's the consequence of being buried alive: she gave herself up to that peasant out of sheer ignorance that better people existed! Too bad! I must be careful not to make her regret her choice.' This last thought might have sounded pretentious, but it wasn't. My neighbor seemed almost repulsive to me; I knew from experience that I was rather attractive. 'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' Heathcliff said, confirming my suspicions."
"As he spoke, he looked at her with a strange expression: a look of hatred; unless he possessed a most perverse facial muscle, incapable, like those of others, of interpreting the language of her soul. ""Ah, certainly... I understand now: you are the privileged possessor of the benevolent fairy,"" I remarked, turning to my neighbor. It was worse than before: the young man blushed and clenched his fist, seeming to attack deliberately. But he seemed to recover quickly and stifled the storm with a cruel oath, which he muttered in my name, but which I carefully ignored. ""Your suspicions are unfortunate, sir,"" my host remarked; ""none of us has the privilege of recognizing your good fairy; her companion is dead."""
"I said she was my daughter-in-law: so she must have married my son. —And this young man is——“ “Not my son, absolutely not.” Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were too impudent a joke to attribute the paternity of this boy to him. “My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I advise you to respect that!” “I meant no disrespect to him,” I replied, laughing inwardly at the dignity with which he had introduced himself. He looked at me longer than I bothered to return his glance, for fear I should be tempted to slap him or give any hint of amusement. I began to feel distinctly out of place in this pleasant family circle."
"The dark spiritual atmosphere overwhelmed, and more than completely, the radiant physical comfort that surrounded me; I therefore decided to be cautious in venturing beneath those beams for the third time. After the meal, and when no one had exchanged a pleasant word, I went to a window to observe the weather. I saw a dismal sight: black night was falling prematurely, and the sky and hills were mingling in a whirl of icy wind and suffocating snow. ""I don't think I can get back without a guide now,"" I could not help exclaiming. ""The roads are already clear; and if they were, I could hardly see a foot."" ""Hareton, get those twelve sheep into the barn."""
"""They'll be covered if they stay in the fold all night; and if a board is put in front of them,"" said Heathcliff. ""How can we do that?"" I continued, my irritation increasing. There was no answer to my question; and when I turned around, I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of gruel for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff stooping over the fire, amusing herself by burning a packet of matches that had fallen from the chimney, while she replaced the tea-box. The former, having laid down his burden, looked critically around the room, and called out in a hoarse voice, ""It's a wonder you can force yourself to stay here, for heaven's sake, when everyone's chasing them! But you're nothing, and it's no good talking; you'll never change your bad habits; you'll go straight to the devil, like your mother before you!"" ""I thought for a moment that this eloquent word was addressed to me. I ran angrily towards the old scoundrel, with the intention of throwing him out."
"Mrs. Heathcliff, however, interrupted me abruptly. ""You scandalous old hypocrite!"" she retorted. ""Aren't you afraid of being literally swept away every time you mention the Devil's name? I warn you not to provoke me, or I shall ask for your removal as a special favor! Stop! Look, Joseph,"" she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; ""I will show you how far I have progressed in the Dark Art: I shall soon be able to attend to it. The red cow did not die by chance; and your rheumatism is far from being attributable to Providence!"" ""Oh, wicked, wicked!"" gasped the elder; ""the Lord deliver us from evil!"" ""No, wicked! You are a castaway—go away, or I will hurt you terribly! I will have you sculpted in wax and clay!"" ""And the first one who oversteps the bounds I have set—I won't say what will happen to him—but you'll see! Come on, I'm watching you!"" The little witch wore mock malice in her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with genuine horror, rushed out praying and crying ""Wicked fellow!"" I thought his behavior must be inspired by some sort of sad amusement; and now that we were alone, I tried to interest him in my grief. ""Mrs. Heathcliff,"" I said gravely, ""you must forgive me for disturbing you."
"I suppose so, for with that face I'm sure you can't help being kind. Show me some landmarks that will enable me to find my way back: I no more know how to get there than you know how to get to London!' 'Take the way you came,' she replied, settling into an armchair with a candle before her, the big book open. 'It's brief advice, but as good as I can give you. So, if you hear that I've been found dead in a bog or a snow pit, won't your conscience whisper to you that it's partly your fault?' 'Why? I can't go with you. They wouldn't let me go to the end of the garden wall.' 'YOU! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold on a night like this, for my convenience,' I cried. I want you to point out the way, not show me the way: otherwise, Mr. Heathcliff will persuade me to give him a guide. — Who? Here he is, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph, and me."
"Which do you prefer? 'Are there no boys at the farm?' 'No, they all are.' 'Then it follows that I am obliged to stay.' 'So that you may settle your accounts with your host. I had nothing to do with it.' 'I hope this will be a lesson to you: make no more rash incursions into these hills!' called Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen door. 'As for staying here, I reserve no spare room: you will have to share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you wish.' 'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied. 'No, no! A stranger is a stranger, whether rich or poor: it does not become me to let anyone explore the place while I am on my guard!' said the wretch. This insult tried my patience to the limit."
"I gave a look of disgust and passed him into the garden, joining Earnshaw in my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the exit; and, as I strolled along, I overheard another instance of their mutual politeness. At first, the young man seemed about to make friends with me. ""I'll go with him to the park,"" he said. ""You'll go to hell with him!"" exclaimed his master, or his family, whoever they were. ""And who will look after the horses, then?"" ""A man's life is worth more than an evening's neglect of horses: somebody must go,"" murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more gently than I expected. ""Not on your orders!"" rejoined Hareton. ""If you're going after him, you'd better keep quiet."" ""Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff never has another tenant before the Grange is in ruins,"" she retorted sharply. ""Listen, listen, they're cursing you!"" whispered Joseph, where I had run."
"He was milking the cows within earshot, by the light of a lantern, which I seized without hesitation. Shouting that I would send him away the next day, I rushed to the nearest back door. ""Master, master, he's hanging up the lantern!"" cried the old man, continuing my retreat. ""Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey, Wolf, stop him!"" As I opened the little door, two hairy monsters sprang at my throat, dragged me to the ground, and put out the light. The mingled laughter of Heathcliff and Hareton crowned my rage and humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more inclined to stretch out their paws, yawn, and wag their tails than to devour me alive; but they refused to revive, and I was forced to lie there until their wicked masters came and freed me. Then, hatless and trembling with rage, I ordered the villains to release me at their peril and to detain me a minute longer, with various incoherent threats of reprisal which, in their indeterminate virulence, recalled King Lear. The violence of my excitement made my nose bleed, and Heathcliff continued to laugh, while I continued to swear."
"I don't know what the scene would have been like if someone more rational and kind than my host had not been present. It was Zillah, the stout housekeeper, who at last came out to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought some of them had seized me violently; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery on the young rascal. ""Now, Mr. Earnshaw,"" she cried, ""I wonder what you are up to? Are we going to murder people on our own doorstep? I see I shall never like this house! Look at that poor fellow, he's almost suffocating! Please, please! You can't go on like this."""
"""Come in, I'll remedy that: here, be quiet."" With that, she suddenly splashed a pint of iced water on my neck and dragged me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed her, his accidental cheerfulness quickly turning into his usual gloom. I felt violently sick, dizzy, and faint; I was therefore compelled to remain with him."
"He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, then went to the inner chamber. While offering me her condolences, and after following her orders, which had somewhat improved my condition, she escorted me to the bed. As she led me upstairs, she advised me to hide the candle and not make a noise, for her master had a strange idea concerning the room in which she would place me and never let anyone stay there of their own free will. I asked her the reason."
"She didn't know, she replied: she had only lived there for a year or two; and so many strange things were happening there that she couldn't even realize it. Too stunned to be stunned myself, I closed my door and looked at the bed. The interior consisted of a chair, a clothes closet, and a large oak wardrobe with carved squares on the top that looked like carriage windows."
"As I approached this structure, I peered inside and saw that it was a curious sort of old-fashioned bench, cleverly designed to save each member of the family from having a room of their own. It formed, in fact, a small closet, and the window-sill it surrounded served as a table. I pushed back the panels, went in with my lamp, closed them, and felt safe from the vigilance of Heathcliff and all the others."
"The ledge where I had placed my candle was crowded with musty books in one corner; it was covered with writing scrawled in the paint. This writing, however, was nothing but a name, repeated in all sorts of letters, large and small: CATHERINE EARNSHAW, alternating here and there with CATHERINE HEATHCLIFF, and then again with CATHERINE LINTON. In icy apathy, I leaned my head against the window and went on spelling Catherine Earnshaw Heathcliff–Linton, until my eyes closed; but they had not been silent five minutes when a glitter of white letters sprang up from the darkness, as vivid as ghosts—the air teemed with Catherine; and when I tried to banish that indiscreet name, I discovered that the wick of my candle was resting on one of the old books, perfuming the place with the scent of toasted calfskin."
"I blew it out and, feeling very ill with a cold and persistent nausea, sat up and spread the battered book across my knee. It was a will, written in small letters, and it smelled terribly musty. A flyleaf bore the inscription 'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date a quarter of a century ago. I closed it and took out another, and another, until I had examined everything."
"Catherine's library was of good quality, and its dilapidated condition proved that it had been well used, if not exclusively for legitimate purposes: hardly a chapter escaped her, a pen-and-ink commentary—or at least a semblance of one—filling every blank left by the printer. Some sections consisted of isolated sentences; others seemed like a simple diary entry, scrawled in clumsy, childish handwriting. At the top of an extra page (probably a treasure trove, for all I know), I discovered to my delight an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, crudely but powerfully drawn."
"My interest in the unknown Catherine was immediately piqued, and I set about deciphering her faded hieroglyphs. ""A dreadful Sunday,"" began the next paragraph. ""I wish my father were back. Hindley is a loathsome substitute—his behavior toward Heathcliff is abominable—H. and I shall rebel—we have taken our first step tonight."" It had rained heavily all day; we could not go to church, so Joseph was forced to hold a service in the attic; and while Hindley and his wife lounged downstairs before a warm fire—doing everything except read their Bibles, I vouch for that—Heathcliff, I, and the unfortunate ploughman were ordered to lay down our prayer books and mount our horses: we were lined up, groaning and shivering, on a sack of grain, in the hope that Joseph would also tremble so that he could give us a short sermon. Vain imagination! The service lasted exactly three hours; yet my brother had the nerve to exclaim when he saw us coming down, ""What, it's over already?"" On Sunday evenings, we were allowed to play as long as we didn't make too much noise; today, a laugh is enough to corner us. ""You forget that you have a master here,"" said the tyrant. ""I'll kill anyone who gets in my way! I demand absolute sobriety and silence."""
"Oh dear! Was that you? Frances, darling, pull his hair as you pass: I heard her snapping her fingers. Frances pulled his hair enthusiastically, then sat on her husband's lap, and they stayed there like two babies, kissing for hours and talking nonsense—nonsense we would have been ashamed of. We made ourselves as comfortable as possible under the vault of the chest of drawers. I had just tied our aprons together and hung them up as a curtain when Joseph came in to run an errand in the stable."
"He tears up my work, hits me on the ears, and groans: ""The Master is barely buried, the Sabbath is not yet over, and the Gospel is still ringing in your ears, and you should be ashamed! Shame on you! Sit down, sick child! There are enough good books if you want to read them: Sit down and think of your soul!"" With these words, he forced us to sit so that we could receive a faint ray of the distant fire, which would reveal the text of the wood he had forced upon us. I could not bear the effort. I snatched my filthy book from the synagogue and threw it into the niche, vowing that I hate good books."
"Heathcliff stamped his foot on the same spot. Suddenly there was a commotion! ""Master Hindley!"" our chaplain called. ""Master, come here! Miss Cathy has torn off the rim of the 'Helm of Salvation,' and Heathcliff has stuck his paw into the first part of 'The Road to Destruction'!"" It's absolutely ridiculous to let them escape like that. Yes! The old man tied them up carefully, but he's gone!"" Hindley rushed out of his fireplace paradise, grabbed one by the collar, the other by the arm, and threw us both into the scullery. Joseph assured him, ""Old Nick would surely come for us."" Thus reassured, we each found a secluded spot to wait for him."
"I took this book and an inkstand from a shelf, opened the front door a crack to admit light, and have been writing for twenty minutes; but my companion grows impatient, and suggests we take the milkmaid's coat and run out onto the heath under the lean-to. A nice suggestion—and when the old curmudgeon comes in, he may think his prophecy is true—we can't be wetter or colder than here in the rain. ****** I suppose Catherine carried out her plan, for the next sentence was on a different subject: She began to cry. 'How little I thought Hindley would ever make me cry like this!' she wrote. 'My head aches until I can't keep it down on my pillow; and yet I cannot stop. Poor Heathcliff!' Hindley calls him a tramp and won't let him sit or eat with us anymore; and he says he and I have no right to play together and threatens to throw him out of the house if we disobey his instructions."
"He accused our father (how dare he?) of treating H. too generously and swears to put him in his place."" ****** I began to nod sleepily over the dark page; my gaze wandered from the manuscript to the print. My eye fell on a red-embellished heading: ""Seventy times seven and the first of the seventy-first."" A pious discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabez Branderham in the chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half-consciously wondering what Jabez Branderham would think of his subject, I sank back into bed and fell asleep. Woe to the bad tea and the bad temper! What could have given me such a dreadful night? I cannot remember a night like it, for I was capable of suffering."
"I began to dream almost before I even noticed my surroundings. I thought it was morning and I had returned home with Joseph as my guide. The snow piled up meters across our path; and as we stumbled along, my companion continually reproached me for not having a pilgrim's staff with me: Without it, I would never get into the house, and he boasted about a cumbersome club, which, I understood, also bore his name."
"For a moment, I thought it absurd that such a weapon would be needed to get into my house. Then a new idea came to me. I wouldn't go: we were going to hear Jabez Branderham's famous sermon, taken from the text ""Seventy Times Seven""; and either Joseph the Preacher or I had committed the ""First of the Seventy-One"" and would be publicly denounced and excommunicated."
"We reached the chapel. I passed it two or three times on my walks; it lies in a hollow between two hills, a raised hollow, near a marsh whose peat juice is said to be used to embalm the few corpses lying there. The roof has so far remained intact; but since a minister's annual salary is only twenty pounds, and a two-room house can quickly be converted into one, no minister will assume the duties of a vicar, especially since his congregation, it is said, would rather let him starve than supplement their income with a penny from his pocket."
"But in my dream, Jabez had a large and attentive congregation; and he preached—my God! What a sermon! It was divided into 430 sections, each identical to a classic pulpit, and each section dealt with a different sin! Where he got them, I don't know. He had his own way of interpreting the sentence, and it seemed necessary that the brother commit different sins on each occasion. They were of a most remarkable nature: strange transgressions on a scale I had never before imagined."
"Oh, how tired I am! How I have writhed, yawned, nodded, and come to my senses again! How I have pinched myself, pricked myself, rubbed my eyes, gotten up, sat down again, and nudged Joseph to tell me if he had ever done anything. I had to listen to everything until he finally came to ""THE FIRST OF THE SEVENTY-ONE."" At this crucial moment, a sudden inspiration came over me; I stood up and condemned Jabez Branderham as the culprit of a sin for which no Christian needs forgiveness. ""Lord,"" I cried, ""sitting here within these four walls, I have, at one fell swoop, endured and forgiven all four hundred and ninety points of your argument."""
"Seventy times seven I took my hat and wanted to leave. Seventy times seven you ridiculously forced me back into my place. Four hundred and ninety-one is too many. Comrade martyrs, seize him! Tear him to the ground and smash him, so that the place that knows him will no longer recognize him! ""YOU ARE THE MAN!"" cried Jabez after a solemn pause, leaning back on his pillow. Seventy times seven her face twisted. Seventy times seven I spoke to my soul. See, this is human weakness: this too can be forgiven! The first of the seventy-one has arrived."
"Brothers, execute the sentence written against him. What honor is due to all his saints!"" At these words, the entire assembly, brandishing their pilgrim staffs, pressed around me in crowds; and I, without a weapon for defense, began to wrestle for Joseph, my nearest and fiercest attacker, in his cause. Several clubs crossed in the crowd; the blows aimed at me struck other candlesticks."
"Soon the whole chapel echoed with blows and counter-blows: each rose against his neighbor; and Branderham, refusing to keep still, gave vent to his fury in a flurry of violent blows on the pulpit boards, which reacted so quickly that they finally awakened me, to my unspeakable relief. And what had caused this uproar? What part had Jabez played in this quarrel? Merely a pine branch brushing my trellis while the wind howled, its dry pine cones rattling against the panes! I listened doubtfully for a moment; I spotted the troublemaker, then turned over, dozed off, and dreamed again: if possible even more unpleasantly than before. This time I remembered that I was lying in the oak chamber, and I distinctly heard the gusts and the passing wind; I also heard the pine branch repeating its teasing cry and attributed this to the precise cause. But it irritated me so much that I decided to silence the noise if possible. I told myself: I'll get up and try to loosen the window frame."
"The hook was welded to the staple: a detail I had noticed upon waking, but which I had forgotten. ""I must stop!"" I muttered, cracking my knuckles through the glass and reaching out to grasp the offending branch; instead, my fingers closed around those of a small, icy hand! The intense terror of a nightmare came over me: I tried to withdraw my arm, but the small hand seized it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed, ""Let me in! Let me in!"" ""Who are you?"" I asked, struggling to free myself. ""Catherine Linton,"" she answered tremblingly (why did I think of LINTON? I had read Linton to EARNSHAW twenty times)—""I came in: I was lost on the moor!"" As she spoke, I saw dimly the face of a child looking out of the window. Fear made me cruel; And since it seemed useless to shake the creature, I pulled her wrist across the broken windowpane and rubbed it back and forth until the blood dripped out and soaked the bedspread. She moaned incessantly, ""Let me in!"" and her screams never stopped, driving me almost mad with fear. ""How can I?"" I finally said. ""Let ME go if you want me to let you in!"" Her fingers went limp, I pulled mine through the hole, hastily stacked the books against her in a pyramid, and covered my ears to drown out the plaintive prayer. It seemed to me as if I had closed them for a quarter of an hour; but as soon as I listened again, I heard the plaintive cry ringing out over and over again! ""Go away!"" I cried. ""I'll never let you in, even if you beg for 20 years."" ""20 years,"" the voice groaned, ""20 years."""
"""I've been a vagabond for twenty years!"" Then there was a faint scratching sound outside, and the stack of books shifted as if it had been pushed. I tried to get up, but couldn't move a limb; so, seized by fear, I cried out loudly. To my surprise, I found that this cry wasn't exactly pleasant: Hurried footsteps approached my bedroom door; someone pushed it open with a strong hand, and a light shone through the panes at the head of the bed."
"I was still shivering and wiping the sweat from my brow. The intruder seemed to hesitate, muttering to himself. Finally, he asked quietly, apparently without waiting for an answer, ""Is anyone here?"" I thought it best to make my presence known, for I knew Heathcliff's accent and was afraid he would stop looking for me if I remained silent. With that in mind, I turned around and opened the doors."
"I won't soon forget the effect of my gesture. Heathcliff stood in the doorway, shirtless and breeches in hand, a candle dripping over his fingers, his face as pale as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak tree made him jump like an electric shock: the light radiated several meters from his hand, and his excitement was so great that he could barely contain it. ""It's only your guest, sir,"" I cried, to spare him the humiliation of further revealing his cowardice. ""I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, due to a terrible nightmare."""
"""I'm sorry to have disturbed you."" ""Oh, damn it, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were here..."" my host began, placing the candle on a chair, unable to keep it upright. ""And who let you into this room?"" he continued, digging his nails into his palms and gritting his teeth to suppress the spasms in his upper jaw. ""Who did it? I intend to have her thrown out immediately?"" ""It was your servant Zillah,"" I replied, throwing myself onto the floor and hastily getting dressed again. ""I wouldn't have taken offense, Mr. Heathcliff; she deserved it. I suppose she wanted further proof that this place is haunted, at my expense. But it's true, it's crawling with ghosts and goblins! You have every reason to lock it up, I assure you."""
"No one will thank you for a nap in such a hole! ""What do you mean?"" asked Heathcliff, ""and what do you do? Lie down and watch all night, since you're here; but for goodness' sake! Don't make that horrible noise: nothing would excuse it unless your throat was cut! If that little monster had come in through the window, it probably would have strangled me!"" I replied. ""I will tolerate no more persecution from your Hospitaller ancestors. Wasn't the Reverend Jabez Branderham related to you on your mother's side? And that tramp, Catherine Linton or Earnshaw, or whatever her name was—she must have been a changeling—a wicked little soul! She told me she'd been on earth for twenty years: a just punishment for her fatal transgressions, I'm sure!"" No sooner had he uttered these words than I remembered the connection between Heathcliff and Catherine's name in the book, which had completely vanished from my memory until I awoke. I blushed at my negligence, but without further acknowledging the error, I hastened to add: ""Indeed, sir, I spent the first part of the night—"" Here I paused again—I was about to say, ""In reading these old books,"" which would have revealed my knowledge of their written and printed contents; then I corrected myself and continued: ""In spelling the name scrawled on this windowsill."""
"A monotonous activity designed to lull me to sleep, like counting or—""Why do you talk to me like that?"" thundered Heathcliff with wild violence. ""How, how dare you, under my roof?"" ""Good God! He's mad to talk like that!"" And he struck his forehead angrily. I hesitated whether to detest this language or insist on my explanation; but he seemed so deeply affected that I was seized with pity and continued to dream. I confessed that I had never heard the name ""Catherine Linton"" before, but the repeated reading of it made an impression that became embodied as my imagination lost control. As I spoke, Heathcliff sank slowly back into the bed; at last he sat up and was almost hidden behind it."
"I suspected, however, from his irregular and labored breathing that he was struggling with strong emotions. Not wanting him to know that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, glanced at the clock, and chorused about the length of the night: ""Not even three o'clock! I could have sworn it was six o'clock. Time stands still here: we had to go to bed at eight to sleep!"" ""Always up at nine and four in winter,"" said my host, suppressing a groan; and, as I imagined, with a wave of his arm, he wiped a tear from his eye. ""Mr. Lockwood,"" he added, ""you may come into my room; you are only a nuisance coming down so early; and your childish screaming has cost me sleep."" ""And mine too,"" I replied. ""I will walk in the garden until dawn and then leave; and you needn't be afraid that I will disturb you again."""
"I am now completely cured of seeking pleasure in company, whether in the country or in the city. A sensible man should find enough company within himself. ""Pleasant company!"" murmured Heathcliff. ""Take the candle and go wherever you will. I will come to you at once."""
"But stay away from the garden, the dogs are loose; and from the house... Juno is guarding there, and... no, you can only loiter on the stairs and in the corridors. But come on! I'll be there in two minutes! I obeyed and even left the room; then, not knowing where the narrow corridors led, I stopped and unwillingly witnessed a superstition of my owner, which strangely contradicted his apparent reason. He climbed onto the bed and opened the gate, bursting into tears. ""Come in! Come in!"" he sobbed. ""Cathy, come in."""
"Oh, do it... ONCE MORE! Oh, my darling! Listen to me carefully, Catherine! The specter was exhibiting his usual caprices: there was no sign of life; but snow and wind whirled wildly, reaching even my post and extinguishing the light. The wave of grief that accompanied this commotion was so terrible that my pity made me forget his madness. I withdrew, half angry at having listened, and half annoyed at having recounted my ridiculous nightmare; so much anguish did it cause me; but the WHY was incomprehensible to me. Cautiously descending into the underworld, I found myself in the scullery, where a stream of fire, concentrated into a thin beam, enabled me to relight my candle."
"Nothing stirred, except for a gray-spotted cat that emerged from the ashes and greeted me with a plaintive meow. Two benches arranged in a circle almost surrounded the fireplace; I lay down on one, Grimalkin climbed onto the other. We both nodded before anyone could enter our hiding place, and then it was Joseph who descended a wooden ladder through a trapdoor that disappeared into the roof: access to his attic, I assume."
"He cast a grim glance at the small flame I had lit between his ribs, pushed the cat from its perch, sat down in the empty space, and began to fill a three-inch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctuary was clearly regarded as an insolence, too shameful to be noticed: silently, he raised the pipe to his lips, folded his arms, and took a drag. I let him enjoy this luxury without the slightest concern; and after emptying his last tankard and heaving a deep sigh, he rose and departed as solemnly as he had come."
"Then I heard quieter footsteps; I opened my mouth to say ""Good morning,"" but closed it again when the greeting didn't come. Hareton Earnshaw was busy reciting his hymn ""Sotto Voce,"" a series of curses he directed at every object he touched while he searched a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the snowdrifts. He peered over the back of his seat with flared nostrils, thinking no more of exchanging pleasantries with me than with my companion, the cat. His preparations anticipated that I might be allowed out, and I rose from my hard seat and followed him a step."
"He noticed this and jabbed his spade against an interior door, signaling to me with an inaudible noise that this was where I should go if I changed my address. The door opened into the house, where the women were already busy; Zillah was blowing flames into the fireplace with a huge bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff was kneeling before the hearth, reading a book near the flames. She held her hand between the heat of the stove and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her work. She only paused to reprimand the servant who was covering her with sparks, or sometimes to push away a dog that was sticking its nose in her face."
"I was surprised to see Heathcliff too. He was standing by the fire with his back to me after a stormy scene with poor Zillah, who occasionally paused to gather her apron and groan indignantly. ""And you, you good-for-nothing—"" he cried upon my entrance, turning to his daughter-in-law and uttering an oath as innocuous as ""duck"" or ""sheep,"" but usually marked with a hyphen. ""There you go again with your useless antics! Others earn their bread—you live on my charity! Stop your nonsense and find yourself something to do. You will pay me for the torture of having you constantly in my sight—do you hear me, you accursed hussy?"" ""I will stop my nonsense, for you can force me to refuse,"" replied the young woman, closing her book and flinging it onto a chair. ""But I will do nothing, even if you curse your tongue, except what I want!"" Heathcliff raised his hand, and the speaker stepped back to a safer distance, obviously accustomed to his weight."
"Not wanting to quarrel like cat and dog, I quickly approached her, as if to enjoy the warmth of the fire and not even notice the interrupted argument. Both showed enough grace to end the hostilities: Heathcliff, tempted, put his fists in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff pursed her lips and sat down on a nearby chair, where she kept her word and played the role of a statue for the rest of my stay. This didn't last long."
"I declined their breakfast and, at dawn, took the opportunity to escape into the fresh air, which was now clear and still and cold as icy ice. My host warned me to stop before the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. He had done well, for the entire ridge formed a vast, white, undulating ocean; the waves and depressions suggested no corresponding relief; at least, many depressions were partially filled; and entire chains of hills, remnants of the quarries, had disappeared from the map that my walk yesterday had seared into my memory."
"I had noticed a row of standing stones on one side of the road, spaced every six or seven meters across the entire length of the barren landscape. They had been purpose-built and plastered with lime to serve as landmarks in the dark, even when, as now, a waterfall cut through the deep marshes on either side of the more difficult path. But apart from a few dirty patches here and there, all trace of their existence had vanished. My companion felt the need to remind me repeatedly to turn right or left when I thought I was following the road's switchbacks correctly. We chatted briefly, and he paused at the entrance to Thrushcross Park and said, ""I can't have been mistaken."" We said goodbye with a curt bow, and then I drove on, confident in my own strength; for the gatehouse was still unoccupied."
"The distance between the gate and the barn is three kilometers; I think I walked four kilometers, after getting lost among the trees and buried up to my neck in snow: a situation that only those who have experienced it can understand. As I entered the house, the clock struck midnight; that meant exactly one hour for every kilometer traveled along the usual route from Wuthering Heights. My human body and its satellites rushed to meet me, crying out loud that they had completely given up: everyone presumed I had died the previous night and wondered how to begin the search for my remains."
"I ordered them to be silent, seeing me return, and, numb to the core, dragged myself upstairs. From there, I put on dry clothes and paced the floor for thirty or forty minutes to keep warm. Then I retired to my study, weak as a kitten: almost too weak to enjoy the warm fire and the steaming coffee the chambermaid had brewed for my refreshment. What vain weathervanes we are! I, who had resolved to abstain from all social intercourse, and who thanked my good fortune to have finally landed in a place where that was practically impossible—I, a weak wretch who had struggled with sadness and loneliness until dusk, was finally forced to take down my flag. Under the pretext of inquiring about the needs of my lodgings, when Mrs. Dean brought in dinner, I asked her to sit down while I ate it. I sincerely hoped she turned out to be a real gossip, and that her chatter would either cheer me up or put me to sleep. ""You've lived here a long time,"" I began. ""Didn't you say sixteen years?"" ""Eighteen, sir. I came to the mistress's wedding to wait on her; after her death, the master hired me as housekeeper."" ""Indeed."" There was silence. She wasn't a gossip, I feared; unless it concerned her own affairs, in which I had little interest."
"But after studying for a while, her fists on her knees, a touch of thoughtfulness across her flushed face, she exclaimed, ""Ah, times have changed since then!"" ""Yes,"" I remarked. ""You've seen many changes, I suppose?"" ""Yes, and trouble too,"" she said. ""Oh, I'll start the conversation with my landlord's family!"" I thought. ""A good subject to begin with! And the beautiful widow—I'd like to know her story: Is she a local or, more likely, a stranger the grumpy local doesn't recognize as his family."" With that in mind, I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff had rented Thrushcross Grange, preferring to live in such squalid conditions and accommodations. ""Isn't he rich enough to manage the estate?"" I asked. ""Rich, sir!"" she replied. ""He has who knows how much money, and it grows every year."" Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a nicer house, but he's very short of money. Even if he'd intended to run away to Thrushcross Grange, he wouldn't have passed up the opportunity to earn a few hundred more the moment he heard of a good tenant. It's strange how people can be so greedy when they're alone in the world! ""He apparently had a son?"" ""Yes, he did; he's dead."" ""And this young woman, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?"" ""Yes."" ""Where did she come from?"" ""Well, sir, she's my late master's daughter; Catherine Linton was her maiden name."""
"I took care of her, poor thing! I wish Mr. Heathcliff would settle here; we could have seen each other again. ""What? Catherine Linton?"" I exclaimed in surprise. But after a moment's reflection, I convinced myself it wasn't my ghostly Catherine. ""Then,"" I continued, ""my predecessor's name is Linton?"" ""His name was Linton."" ""And who is this Earnshaw, Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr. Heathcliff? Are they related?"" ""No, he is the nephew of the late Mrs. Linton."" ""Then the young lady's nephew?"" ""Yes, and her husband was also her nephew: one on her mother's side, the other on her father's. Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister."" ""I see the house in Wuthering Heights has the inscription 'Earnshaw' on it."""
"Are they an old family? ""Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you ever been to Wuthering Heights? Excuse me, but I should like to know how she is!"" ""Mrs. Heathcliff? She was very pretty and very handsome; but, I think, not very happy."" ""Oh dear, I'm not surprised! And what did you think of the gentleman?"" ""Rather a rough fellow, Mrs. Dean. Isn't that his temper? Rough as a saw and hard as a stake! The less you have to do with him, the better."" ""He must have had his ups and downs in his life to become such a lout."""
"Do you know his past?' 'He's mad, sir! I know everything about him: except where he was born, who his parents were, and how he earned his money. And Hareton was brought up like a young sparrow! The unfortunate man is the only one in the whole parish who doesn't suspect how he was framed.' 'Well, Mrs. Dean, it would be a charitable act if you told me something about my neighbors: I don't think I could sleep if I went to bed; so, if you will be so kind as to sit down and chat for an hour.' 'Oh, certainly, sir! I'll do some sewing and then sit as long as you like. But you have a cold: I've seen you shivering, and you need porridge to cure it.' The worthy woman hurried away, and I huddled nearer the fire; my head was hot and the rest of my body was cold. I was also nervous and mentally agitated almost to the point of insanity."
"It was not that that worried me, but (as still does) the grave consequences of the events of today and yesterday. She returned a little later with a steaming bowl and a work basket; after placing the former on the hearth, she sat down, evidently pleased to find me so sociable. Before I moved here, she began—without waiting for further prompting to tell her story—that I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; for my mother had been looking after Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton's father, and I had begun to play with the children; besides, I ran errands, helped with the haymaking, and hung around the farmyard, ready to listen to anything anyone wanted to tell me."
"One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of the grape harvest, if I remember correctly—Mr. Earnshaw, the old gentleman, came downstairs, ready to travel. After explaining to Joseph what would happen that day, he turned to Hindley, Cathy, and me—for I was sitting with them eating porridge—and said to his son, ""Well, my dear, I'm going to Liverpool today. What shall I take? You can choose what you like. It shall only be a short journey, for I have to walk there and back; sixty miles there and back is a long journey!"" Hindley mentioned a fiddle and then asked Miss Cathy; she was barely six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable and chose a whip. He didn't forget me, for he was kind-hearted, if sometimes a little stern. He promised to bring me a bag full of apples and pears, then kissed his children goodbye and left."
"Those three days of absence seemed long to all of us, and little Cathy often asked when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected him around noon on the third evening and postponed dinner for several hours; but there was no sign of his arrival, and finally the children grew tired of constantly running to the gate and watching. Then night fell; she would have sent them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and around eleven o'clock the doorknob opened softly, and the teacher came in."
"He sank into a chair, laughing and groaning, and ordered them to step aside, for he had almost been killed—he did not want to take another walk like this through the Three Kingdoms. “And in the end, I shall be chased to my death!” he said, opening his coat, which he held tightly in his arms. “You see, woman! I have never been beaten so badly in my life, but you must still consider it a gift from God; even if it is almost as grim as if it came from the devil.” We crowded around Miss Cathy, and over Miss Cathy’s head I watched a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough to walk and talk: his face did look older than Catherine’s; but as soon as he was on his feet, he just looked around, talking incessantly about himself and talking nonsense that no one understood. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was about to throw him out. She rushed over and asked how he had managed to bring this gypsy girl into the house when they had children of their own to feed and raise. What did he intend to do with her, and had he gone mad? The gentleman tried to explain the situation, but was completely exhausted, and all I could gather from his grumbling was that he had seen her starving, homeless, and almost mute on the streets of Liverpool, picked her up, and asked for her owner. No one knew who she belonged to, he said; and since he had little money or time, he thought it best to take her home immediately rather than incur unnecessary expense, as he was determined not to leave her in the same condition in which he found her."
"Well, the result was that my mistress murmured softly; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash him, give him clean clothes, and let him sleep with the children. Hindley and Cathy just watched and listened until quiet returned; then they both began to rummage in their father's pockets for the presents he had promised them. The first was a fourteen-year-old boy, but when he produced a fiddle that was crushed in his coat, he began to sob loudly; and when Cathy heard that the master had lost his whip while serving the stranger, she showed her humor by smiling and spitting on the little animal, which earned her a good spanking from her father to teach her manners."
"They categorically refused to allow him into their bed or even into their room. At my wit's end, I left him on the landing, hoping he would be gone the next day. By chance, or lured by the sound of his voice, he crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door and found him leaving his room. They inquired about his arrival; I was forced to confess and was expelled from the house as a reward for my cowardice and inhumanity."
"This was Heathcliff's first acquaintance with the family. When I returned a few days later (for I did not consider my banishment final), I learned that they had called him ""Heathcliff"": this was the name of a son who had died young, and it had served him ever since both as a Christian and as a family name. He and Miss Cathy had become very much at odds; but Hindley hated him; and so did I. We teased him and treated him with disgrace; for I had not enough sense to feel the wrong I was doing, and the mistress never spoke to him when she saw him wronged."
"He seemed like a sullen and patient child, perhaps hardened by his abuse: he bore Hindley's blows without flinching or shedding a tear, and my pinches only made him breathe and open his eyes, as if he had accidentally hurt himself without anyone blaming him. This endurance drove old Earnshaw to despair when he discovered that his son was stalking the poor fatherless boy, as he called him. He felt a strange attachment to Heathcliff, believed everything he said (though he said very little, and mostly the truth), and valued him far more than Cathy, who was too mischievous and stubborn to be his favorite."
"Thus, from the beginning, he maintained resentment in the house; and after Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which occurred less than two years later, the young master regarded his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parents' affections and privileges; and he became bitter from brooding over this injustice. I sympathized for a time; but when the children were swept away by the measles, and I had to care for them as well as my wife, I changed my mind. Heathcliff was gravely ill; and in his worst times, I was constantly at his side. I suppose he felt I was doing much for him, and was not aware that I was under a duty to do so."
"But I must say, he was the quietest child any nanny has ever had. The difference between him and the others forced me to be less judgmental. Cathy and her little brother got on my nerves terribly: He was as whiny as a lamb; but his harshness, not his gentleness, caused him little trouble."
"He recovered, and the doctor, realizing I owed him much, congratulated me on my recovery. I was proud of his praise and became more indulgent toward the man who deserved it. Thus, Hindley lost his last ally. But I failed to charm Heathcliff, and I often wondered what my master admired so much in that gloomy fellow; who, as far as I remember, never showed him the slightest gratitude. He was not rude to his benefactor; he was simply unfeeling; though he was conscious of his hold on his heart and knew that a single word would suffice to subjugate the entire household to his wishes."
"I remember, for example, how Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of foals at the church fair and gave one to each boy. Heathcliff took the prettiest, but it soon developed a limp. When he found out, he said to Hindley, ""You must trade your horses with me. I don't like mine. And if you don't, I'll tell your father about the three blows you gave me this week and show him my arm, which is black all the way to the shoulder."" Hindley stuck out his tongue and slapped him on the ears. ""Better do it right now,"" he insisted, running out to the veranda (they were in the stable). ""You must do it. And when I tell you about the blows, you'll get them back with interest."" ""Go away, dog!"" ""Hindley cried, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. ""Throw it down,"" he replied, stopping, ""and I'll tell you how you boasted you'd send me away as soon as it was dead, and I'll see if it doesn't send you away right away."" Hindley threw it and hit him on the chest. The animal fell, but got up immediately, panting and pale; and if I hadn't stopped him, he would have gone straight to the master and taken revenge by redeeming his situation and revealing who was the cause. ""Then take my colt, Gypsy!"" said young Earnshaw. ""And I pray he'll break your neck. Take it, and he'll curse you, you poor intruder! And he'll blame my father for everything he has."" So show him who you are, you devil."" And take this, I hope it blows your brains out!"" Heathcliff had gone to untie the animal and lead it into its stable. After he had finished his speech, he ran after Hindley, beating him underfoot. Without checking whether his hopes had been realized, he ran off as fast as he could. I was amazed to see with what composure the child regained his senses and continued with his plan; he changed saddles and then sat down on a bale of hay to overcome the remorse caused by the violent blow he had received before entering the house."
"I easily convinced him to attribute his bruises to the horse: He didn't care what story was told, because he already had what he wanted. He complained so rarely about such problems that I didn't think he was vindictive: I had, as you will hear, been completely cheated. Over time, Mr. Earnshaw's condition worsened."
"He had been active and healthy, but suddenly his strength left him; and when he locked himself near the fireplace, he became terribly irritable. Nothing could disturb him; the slightest insult to his authority drove him almost to a rage. This was especially noticeable when someone tried to influence or dominate his favorite: he was terribly jealous of anyone who spoke unkindly to him; he seemed to have understood that everyone hated him and wanted to harm him because he loved Heathcliff."
"This was a disadvantage for the boy; for the kindest among us did not want to anger the teacher, so we indulged his partiality; and this indulgence only fed the child's pride and capriciousness. Yet in a way it was necessary; two or three times, while his father was there, Hindley's contempt provoked the old man to anger: he seized his staff to strike him, and trembled with rage because he could not. At last our minister (we had a minister then who offered the practical solution by teaching little Linton and Earnshaw and cultivating his own piece of land) advised the young man to go to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though in a melancholy voice, for he said, ""Hindley was nothing and would never succeed wandering about."" I sincerely hoped we would now have peace."
"It pained me that the master would be ashamed of his good deed. I suspected that the discontent over age and illness was due to family discord; and indeed, it was as he had wished: you know, sir, it was due to his declining health. Nevertheless, we would have gotten along quite well if it hadn't been for two people: Miss Cathy and Joseph, the servant; you must have seen him up there."
"He was and is probably the most boring and self-righteous Pharisee who ever leafed through the Bible, read out promises, and cursed his neighbors. His gift for preaching and his pious speeches made a deep impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the weaker his master became, the greater his influence grew. He was incessantly concerned for the welfare of his soul and the strict guidance of his children."
"He encouraged them to regard Hindley as a depraved man; and night after night he regularly whispered a long series of stories to Heathcliff and Catherine, always trying to flatter Earnshaw's weakness by blaming her. She certainly had a knack for things I have never seen in any child; and she tried our patience fifty times a day and more: from the hour she went downstairs to the hour she went to bed, we never had the slightest assurance that she was not up to mischief. She was always good-humored, her tongue always at work: she sang, laughed, and teased anyone who compelled her."
"She was a wild and wicked bitch, but she had the most beautiful eyes, the sweetest smile, and the lightest foot in the whole parish. Finally, I believe she meant no harm; for when she did make you cry, she rarely kept you company and forced you to be silent so you could comfort her. She loved Heathcliff far too much. The worst punishment we could imagine for her was to separate her from him. Yet she was held more responsible for this than any of us."
"When playing, she loved to play the little mistress; she used her hands freely and gave orders to her comrades; she did the same with me, but I could not bear to be beaten and bossed around; so I let her know this. Now Mr. Earnshaw did not understand his children's jokes: he had always been stern and strict with them; and Catherine, for her part, did not understand why her father was angrier and more impatient in his sickly state than in the prime of his life. His surly rebukes awakened in her a spiteful delight in provoking him: she was never so happy as when we all scolded her at once, and she defied us with her insolent, impudent look and her hasty words; She mocked Joseph's religious curses, tested me, and did the very thing his father hated most: she showed how his feigned brutality, which he believed to be real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy followed HER orders in everything and HIS only when it suited him."
"After behaving badly all day, she would sometimes come to me in the evening and let me hug her. ""No, Cathy,"" the old man would say, ""I can't love you; you're worse than your brother. Go, pray, my little one, and ask God for forgiveness. I doubt your mother knows you, and I'm sorry we raised you!"" This first made her cry; then fueled her constant resentment, and she laughed when I told her to repent of her mistakes and ask for forgiveness."
"But finally, the hour came that put an end to Mr. Earnshaw's earthly troubles. He died peacefully in his armchair by the fire one October evening. A strong wind blew around the house and rushed up the chimney. The noise was fierce and stormy, but it was not cold, and we were all together: I, a little way from the fireplace, was knitting diligently, and Joseph was reading his Bible at the table (for the servants were usually at home at this time, having finished their work)."
"Miss Cathy had been ill and was therefore silent. She was leaning on her father's knees, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head on her knees. I still remember how, before she fell asleep, the Lord stroked her beautiful hair—he had seldom seen her so gentle—and she asked, ""Why can't you always be good, Cathy?"" She turned her face to him, laughed, and answered, ""Why can't you always be good, Father?"" But when she saw him cross again, she kissed his hand and said she would sing him a song to lull him to sleep. She began to sing very softly until her fingers left his and her head sank upon his breast."
"Then I told him to be quiet and not move, because I wanted to wake him up. We all remained completely silent for half an hour, even though it should have been longer. Only Joseph, who had finished his chapter, stood up and asked him to wake the professor for prayer and bedtime. He approached him, called his name, and touched his shoulder, but he didn't move. Then he took the candle and looked at him."
"I thought something was wrong when he turned out the light; he took each child by the arm and whispered to them, ""Come up and make a little noise—they can only pray tonight—he had something to do."" ""I'll say goodnight to Papa first,"" said Catherine, throwing her arms around his neck before we could stop her. The poor child felt her loss at once; she cried, ""Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! He's dead!"" And they began to sob heartily. I joined in their lamentations, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked us what we were all thinking, and howled over some saint in heaven."
"He told me to put on my coat and run to Gimmerton to fetch the doctor and the minister. I had no idea what use they would be. Nevertheless, I went despite the wind and rain, taking one of them, the doctor, with me; the other told me he would come in the morning."
"I left the explanation to Joseph and ran into the nursery. The door was half open; I could see they hadn't gone to bed yet, even though it was past midnight; but they were calmer and didn't need my consolation. The little souls comforted each other with more beautiful thoughts than I could ever have imagined: no priest in the world had ever imagined a heaven as beautiful as they did in their innocent conversations; and as I listened, sobbing, I involuntarily wished we were all safe there, together."
"Hindley came home for the funeral and—which surprised us and got the neighbors talking—he brought a wife with him. He never told us who she was or where she was born: She probably had neither money nor a good reputation, otherwise he would have had a hard time concealing her connection to his father. She wasn't someone who would have contributed much to the household on her own."
"Every object she saw as soon as she crossed the threshold seemed to delight her, as did everything around her, except for the funeral preparations and the presence of the mourners. I thought she was mad when I observed her behavior during this time: she ran to her room and forced me to accompany her, even though I should have dressed the children; and there she sat trembling with clasped hands, asking again and again, ""Are they gone yet?"" Then, in hysterical excitement, she began to describe how the sight of the blackness affected her; she shuddered, trembled, and finally burst into tears. When I asked her what was wrong, she replied, ""She didn't know, but she was so afraid of dying!"" I imagined that she was no more likely to die than I was. She was rather thin, but young, with a fresh complexion, and her eyes shone like diamonds."
"I noticed that she breathed very rapidly when climbing stairs, trembled at the slightest noise, and sometimes coughed unpleasantly. But I didn't know the significance of these symptoms and felt no need to show sympathy. We generally don't like strangers here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they like us first. Young Earnshaw has changed markedly since he left three years ago."
"He had grown thin, lost his color, and spoke and dressed quite differently. On the day of his return, he announced to Joseph and me that from now on we would stay in the scullery and leave the house to him. He would have liked to paper and repaper a small guest room and convert it into a living room; but his wife was so charmed by the white floor, the huge blazing fireplace, the pewter dishes, the puppet theater, the doghouse, and the large gymnasium where they usually sat that he considered them superfluous and therefore abandoned the project. She, too, was delighted to count a sister among her new acquaintances; she chatted with Catherine, kissed her, ran with her, and at first gave her many presents."
"Her affection soon cooled, however, and when she became surly, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her revealing her dislike for Heathcliff were enough to reawaken his old hatred for the boy. He banished him from her company and left him in the care of the servants, deprived him of the vicar's instructions, and insisted on his outdoor work, forcing him to work as hard as any other boy on the farm."
"At first, Heathcliff bore his humiliation quite well. Cathy taught him what she had learned and worked or played with him in the fields. Both promised to grow up as rude as savages; the young gentleman was completely negligent in their behavior and actions, so they kept their distance from him. He never saw him again after Sunday service; only Joseph and the minister reprimanded him for his negligence during their absence, which reminded him that he must whip Heathcliff and fast Catherine."
"Yet one of their greatest pleasures was escaping to the moor in the morning and staying there all day. The punishment for this was a joke. The vicar had the right to write as many chapters as he wanted for Catherine to memorize, and Joseph had the right to beat Heathcliff until his arm ached. They forgot everything as soon as they were together again, or at least as soon as they had hatched a Machiavellian plan of revenge. I often wept as I watched them grow more ruthless day by day, and dared not say a word for fear of losing what little influence I still had over these hostile creatures. One Sunday evening, it happened that they were banished from the drawing-room for fighting or some other minor offense. And when I went to call her to dinner, she was nowhere to be found."
"We searched the house from top to bottom, the yard, and the stables; they were nowhere to be seen. Finally, Hindley, furious, ordered us to lock the gate and swore that no one would let them in that night. The whole family went to bed; I too, impatient to lie down, opened my gate and, despite the rain, stuck my head out to listen. Determined to let them in, despite the prohibition, if they came back. After a while, I heard footsteps coming up the street, and the light of a lantern shone through the gate."
"I threw a handkerchief over my head and ran away to avoid being awakened by Mr. Earnshaw's knocking. Heathcliff was there, all alone; I was surprised to see him alone. ""Where is Miss Catherine?"" I called out hastily. ""Not by chance, I hope?"" ""To Thrushcross Grange,"" he answered; ""and I would have gone there too, but they weren't polite enough to ask me to stay."" ""Well, have it!"" I said. ""You'll never be satisfied until you're back at work. What on earth brought you to Thrushcross Grange?"" ""Let me take off my wet clothes and I'll tell you everything, Nelly,"" he answered."
"I told him not to wake the professor. While he undressed and I waited to blow out the candle, he continued, ""Cathy and I sneaked out of the laundry room to look around. When we saw the lights in the barn, we thought we'd see if the Lintons spend their Sunday evenings shivering in a corner while their parents eat, drink, sing, laugh, and burn their eyes out by the fire. Do you think they do that? Or read sermons, take lessons from their servant, and learn a bunch of Bible verses when they don't answer correctly?"" ""Probably not,"" I replied. ""They're really good children and don't deserve the treatment you're getting for your bad behavior."" ""That can't be right, Nelly,"" he said, ""that's nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park without stopping. Catherine lost the race completely because she was barefoot. Tomorrow you'll have to search the swamp for her shoes."""
"We squeezed through a ragged hedge, groped our way up the path, and settled down in a small flowerbed under the living room window. That's where the light came from; the shutters weren't drawn, the curtains half-drawn. Standing in the cellar, clinging to the windowsill, we could both see in, and we saw—ah! It was magnificent! A magnificent place, with crimson carpets, crimson chairs and tables, and a brilliant white ceiling trimmed in gold, in the center of which a shower of glass droplets hung from silver chains, sparkling in the light of small, dim candles."
"The old Lintons weren't there; Edgar and his sisters were alone. Shouldn't they have been happy? It was like heaven! And guess what your dear children were doing now? Isabella—I think she's eleven, a year younger than Cathy—was screaming through the room as if witches were piercing her with red-hot needles. Edgar was weeping softly by the fire, and in the middle of the table sat a small dog, shaking its paw and whining; and from their mutual reproaches, we gathered that they had almost been separated."
"Those idiots! It was their amusement! They argued over who should get a tuft of warm hair, and both began to cry because, after some struggle, they refused to accept it. We laughed at those pampered creatures; we despised them! When would you find me wanting what Catherine wanted? Or would you find us alone, taking our pleasure in screaming, sobbing, and rolling on the floor, separated by the whole room? I wouldn't exchange my situation here for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange for a thousand lifetimes, even if I had the privilege of throwing Joseph off the highest gable and painting him with Hindley's blood! ""Shh, shh!"" I interrupted. ""Heathcliff, haven't you told me how Catherine was left behind?"" ""I told you we laugh,"" he answered. The Lintons heard us, and shot arrows at the door as if from one mouth; there was silence, then a cry: ""Oh, mother, mother! Oh, father! Oh, mother, come here. Oh, father, oh!"" They cried something like that."
"We made terrifying noises to scare her even more, then we tumbled over the edge because someone was closing the bars, and decided to run away. I was holding Cathy's hand, encouraging her, when she suddenly collapsed. ""Run, Heathcliff, run!"" she whispered. ""They've let the bulldog loose, and he's holding me!"" The devil had grabbed her ankle, Nelly: I heard his horrible growl. She didn't scream—no! She would have reluctantly, if she'd been spat upon by the horns of a mad cow."
"But I managed it: I shouted so many curses that I could destroy every demon in Christendom; I grabbed a stone, shoved it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to ram it down his throat. Finally, a servant came running with a lantern, shouting, ""Stop, Skulker, stop!"" He changed his mind, however, when he saw Skulker's play. The dog was strangled; his huge purple tongue hung out a good six inches, and bloody saliva dripped from his drooping lips."
"The man picked Cathy up; she felt sick: not with fear, I'm sure, but with pain. He carried her inside; I followed him, muttering curses and vengeful. ""What loot, Robert?"" Linton called from the doorway. ""Skulker has a little girl, sir,"" he answered; ""and here's a boy,"" he added, clinging to me, ""who looks just like her! He looks just like the robbers who dragged her out the window to open the doors for the gang after everyone was asleep, so they could kill us at will. Shut up, you rude thief! You'll end up on the hangman for this."""
"Mr. Linton, sir, don't lower your weapon. ""No, no, Robert,"" said the old fool. ""Those scoundrels knew I had to pay my rent yesterday. They thought they could get their hands on me. Come in, I'll give them a warm welcome. Here, John, fasten the chain."""
"Give Skulker some water, Jenny. Attacking a judge in his fortress, and on the Sabbath too! Where will their impudence end? Oh, my dear Mary, look! Don't be afraid, he's only a child—and yet the villain looks so pretentious; wouldn't it be a service to the country to hang him immediately, before he reveals his true colors and deeds? He dragged me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton put on her spectacles and threw up her hands in horror. The cowardly children also came forward, while Isabel whispered, ""Dreadful deed! Take him to the cellar, Papa."""
"He looks just like the son of the fortune-teller who stole my pheasant. Is that right, Edgar? While they were examining me, Cathy came to her senses; she heard the last speech and laughed. Edgar Linton looked curious and found enough humor to recognize her."
"We're seen in church, you know, whereas we rarely see them anywhere else. ""Is that Miss Earnshaw?"" he whispered to his mother, ""and look how Skulker bit her! How her foot is bleeding!"" ""Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!"" cried the lady. ""Miss Earnshaw is traveling across the country with a gypsy! And yet, my dear, the child is grieving—really—and may be left crippled forever!"" ""What culpable neglect of her brother!"" cried Mr. Linton, turning from me to Catherine. ""I've heard from Shielders"" (that was the minister, sir), ""that he's raising her in complete paganism. But who is he? Where did she get that companion? Ouch!"" I assure you, it's that strange acquisition my late neighbor made on his voyage to Liverpool: a little lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway."" ""What a naughty fellow,"" remarked the old lady, ""and quite unfit for a proper home! Did you notice his language, Linton? I'm shocked my children heard it."" I began to swear again—don't be angry, Nelly—and Robert was ordered to take me away. I refused to leave without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pressed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw must be informed of my behavior, and closed the door after ordering me to leave immediately."
"In one corner, the curtains were still drawn, and I resumed my watchful eye; for if Catherine wanted to come back, I would smash the large panes to a thousand pieces if they didn't release her. She sat quietly on the sofa. Mrs. Linton took off the milkmaid's gray coat, which we had borrowed for our outing, shook her head, and, presumably, scolded her: She was a young woman, and they treated her differently than me."
"Then the maid brought a basin of hot water and washed her feet; Mr. Linton made a glass of Negus, and Isabella emptied a plate of biscuits into her lap, while Edgar stood open-mouthed at a distance. Then they dried and combed her beautiful hair, gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and rolled her to the fire; and I left her there, as cheerful as possible, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, pinching whose nose she ate as he ate; and a spark of wit lit in the Lintons' empty blue eyes—a dim reflection of her own charming face. I saw that they were full of stupid admiration; she is so much superior to them—to anyone in the world, isn't she, Nelly? 'More will happen than you think,' I answered, tucking him in and putting out the light. You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley must do all he can to see that he doesn't. My words have come true more than I had hoped."
"This unfortunate adventure drove Earnshaw to despair. To settle the matter, Mr. Linton came to us in person the next day, and the young gentleman preached such a sermon about the journey he was making with his family that he began to look around him seriously. Heathcliff was not flogged, but was told that the first word he uttered to Miss Catherine would bring about his dismissal. Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to detain her sister-in-law on her return; she used cunning, not force: force would have been impossible for her."
"Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks, until Christmas. Her ankle had now fully healed, and her manners had improved considerably. The lady of the house visited her often during this time and began her plan of reform, attempting to boost her self-esteem with fine clothes and flattery, which she gladly accepted. Thus, instead of a small, hatless savage bounding around the house trying to trick us, there appeared a ""very respectable person,"" a beautiful black pony with brown curls falling from its beaver plumage, and a long cloth dress that she had to hold with both hands to put on."
"Hindley lifted her from her horse and exclaimed enthusiastically: ""What a beauty, Cathy! I hardly recognized you: you already look like a lady. Isabella Linton is nothing like her, is she, Frances?"" ""Isabella has not her natural qualities,"" replied his wife, ""but she must be careful not to get out of hand here again. Ellen, help Miss Catherine put away her things. Wait a moment, dear, you are loosening your ringlets. Let me open your hat."" I took off her coat, and there glittered a magnificent checked silk dress, white breeches, and polished shoes; and although her eyes sparkled gaily when the dogs came to greet her, she hardly dared to touch them for fear they might hide her fine clothes."
"She kissed me gently: I had no more flour for the Christmas cake, and embracing me would have been pointless. Then she turned to Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched their meeting intently, thinking it would give them an idea of why they wanted to separate the two friends. Heathcliff was difficult to find at first."
"If he was already unkempt and neglected before Catherine's absence, he had become ten times more so since. No one but me was kind enough to call him a dirty little boy and ask him to wash once a week; and children his age rarely enjoy soap and water. Not to mention his clothes, which had been exposed to mud and dust for three months, and his thick, unkempt hair. His face and hands, too, were terribly dull."
"He could well have hidden behind the sofa when he saw such a bright and graceful young woman enter, instead of her shaggy counterpart, as he had expected. ""Isn't Heathcliff in?"" she asked, pulling off her gloves and revealing her fingers, which were strangely white from inactivity and from being indoors. ""Heathcliff, you may come up,"" cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfort and delighting in what a fearsome young villain he must be imagining. ""You may come in and greet Miss Catherine as the other servants do."" Cathy, seeing her hidden friend, rushed forward to embrace her; she gave her seven or eight kisses on the cheek in a second, then stopped, drew back, burst into laughter, and exclaimed, ""How dark and sullen you look! And how—how funny and sinister!"" ""But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton."" ""Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?"" She was right in her request, for shame and pride darkened his face and left him motionless. ""Help me, Heathcliff,"" said Mr. Earnshaw condescendingly; ""if it's allowed."" ""Not I,"" replied the boy, finally regaining his speech; ""I can't bear to be laughed at. I can't bear it!"" He made to break away from the circle, but Miss Cathy held him back. ""I didn't mean to laugh at you,"" she said; ""I couldn't help it: Heathcliff, at least help me! Why are you so sullen? You only look funny."""
"If you wash your face and comb your hair, everything will be all right. But you are so dirty! She looked anxiously at the black fingers she held in hers and at her dress. She feared it had been dulled by the contact of his. ""You shouldn't have touched me!"" he replied, following her gaze and withdrawing his hand. ""I will be as dirty as I please. And I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty."" With that, he hurried from the room, to the laughter of master and mistress, and to the great dismay of Catherine, who could not understand how his remarks could provoke such an outburst of displeasure. After playing maid to the newcomer, putting my cakes in the oven, and lighting the house and kitchen with large fires as befits Christmas Eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself with Christmas carols all by myself. Although Joseph protested that he did not consider the cheerful melodies I had chosen as songs, he had retired to his room for silent prayer, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw had attracted Missy's attention with all sorts of cheerful trinkets they had bought for her to give to the Linton children as a token of appreciation for their kindness."
"They had invited her to spend the next day at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation was accepted on one condition: Mrs. Linton requested that her pets be carefully kept away from that ""bad boy who swears."" Under these circumstances, I was left alone. I breathed in the rich aroma of warm spices; I admired the gleaming kitchen utensils, the polished clock decorated with holly, the silver tankards on a tray, ready to be filled with mulled wine for dinner; and, above all, the immaculate cleanliness to which I had taken special care: the scrubbed and swept floor. I applauded each item wholeheartedly, and then I remembered old Earnshaw coming in when everything was put away, calling me a hypocrite, and pressing a shilling into my hand like a Christmas present; and then I began to think of his affection for Heathcliff and his fear of being neglected after his death. This, of course, made me think about the poor boy's current situation, and my thoughts changed from singing to crying."
"I soon realized, however, that it would be wiser to atone for some of his mistakes rather than dwell on them. So I got up and went into the yard to look for him. He was not far away; I found him in the stable, where, as usual, he was smoothing the new pony's shiny coat and feeding the other animals. ""Hurry up, Heathcliff!"" I said. ""The kitchen is so cozy; and Joseph is upstairs. Hurry, I want to dress you before Miss Cathy comes out. Then you can sit together, before the fire, and talk for a long time until bedtime."" He continued his work without turning to face me. ""Come—come?"" I asked. ""There's a small cake for each of you, almost enough; and it will take you half an hour to dress."" I waited five minutes but received no reply. Catherine was eating with her brother and sister-in-law. Joseph and I had an unpleasant meal together, with accusations from one and spiteful remarks from the other."
"His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to work until nine o'clock, then went silently and gloomily to his room. Cathy stayed up late, for she had a thousand and one things to prepare for the reception of her new friends. She once went into the kitchen to speak with her old friend; but he was gone, and she stayed only to ask him what was the matter, and then went back again."
"The next morning he got up early, and since it was a holiday, he took his bad mood with him to the moor and didn't reappear until the family had left for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have improved his spirits. He stayed with me for a while, and then, after summoning all his courage, he suddenly called out, ""Nelly, do me a favor; I'll be good."" ""It's high time, Heathcliff,"" I said. ""You've given Catherine grief; she's sorry she came home, I suppose! It's as if you envy her, for she's more highly esteemed than you."" The idea of capturing Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the idea of making her suffer he understood perfectly. ""Did she say she was sad?"" he asked, looking very serious. ""She wept when I told her you came out again this morning."" ""Well, I cried last night,"" he replied, ""and I had more reason to cry than she did."" ""Yes, you were right to go to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach,"" I said. ""Proud people bring grief on themselves."""
"But if you are ashamed of your vulnerability, you must ask her forgiveness, mind you, when she comes in. You must go to her, kiss her, and tell her—you know better than anyone what to say; but do it sincerely, and not as if you thought her beautiful dress made her a stranger. And now, although I must cook dinner, I will take the time to make sure Edgar Linton looks splendid by your side: and he does."
"You are younger, and yet, I tell you, you are taller, and have twice as broad shoulders; you could knock him down in a heartbeat; don't you think you could?"" Heathcliff's face brightened for a moment; then it darkened again, and he sighed. ""But, Nelly, even if I knocked him down twenty times, he would be no less handsome, and I would be more handsome. I wish I had fair hair and a fair complexion, dressed well and behaved well, and been lucky enough to be as rich as he is!"" ""And all around,"" cried Mamma,"" I added, ""and trembled like a country boy who shakes his fist and sits at home all day waiting for a shower. Oh, Heathcliff, you are a poor fellow! Come before the glass, and I'll show you everything you could wish for."""
"Do you see the two wrinkles between your eyes? The thick eyebrows that don't rise in an arch but sink together in the middle? And the pair of black devils, buried so deeply, that never boldly open their windows, but glitter beneath them like the devil's spies? Make a wish and learn to smooth out the sullen wrinkles, lift your eyelids open, and transform the devils into trusting and innocent angels, who suspect and doubt nothing and always see friends where they are unsure of their enemies. Do not make the face of a spiteful fool, who seems to know that the blows he receives are his own doing, and yet hates the whole world, just like the kicker, for what he suffers. ""In other words, I must wish for the large blue eyes and regular brow of Edgar Linton,"" he replied. ""I wish it, and it will avail me nothing."" ""A good heart would help you have a pretty face, my boy,"" I continued, ""if you were a real Negro; and a bad person turns the most beautiful thing into something worse than ugly. And now that we're done washing, combing, and pouting, tell me: don't you think you're beautiful? I'll tell you, honestly."""
"You are worthy of a prince in disguise. Who knows, perhaps your father was Emperor of China and your mother Queen of India, and both could have bought Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a week's wages? And you were kidnapped by cruel sailors and brought to England. If I were you, I would have high hopes about my parentage; and the memory of who I am would give me the courage and dignity to endure the oppression of a smallholder! Thus I prattled on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his sullen expression and assumed a rather pleasant air, when our conversation was suddenly interrupted by a rumble from the street and the courtyard."
"He ran to the window and I to the door. Just in time, I saw the two Lintons, dressed in coats and furs, get out of the family carriage and the Earnshaws dismount; they often rode their bicycles to church in winter. Catherine took each of the children by the hand, led them inside, and set them before the fire, which quickly colored their pale faces. I urged my companion to come quickly and be friendly, and he readily obeyed; but unfortunately, as Hindley opened the kitchen door on one side, he opened it on the other as well."
"They met, and the master, annoyed at his handsome and cheerful appearance, or perhaps anxious to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, elbowed him away and angrily ordered Joseph: ""Keep the fellow out of the room and send him up to the attic until after dinner. He'll put his fingers in the cakes and steal the fruit if he's alone with them for a moment."" ""No, sir,"" I could not help replying, ""he won't touch anything, absolutely not: and I think he deserves his share of dainties as much as we do."" ""He'll have his share from me if I catch him downstairs before dark,"" cried Hindley. ""Get out of here, you tramp! What? Are you trying to catch that slimy creature? Wait until I get those elegant curls—see if I don't pull a little harder!"" ""They're long enough already,"" remarked Mr. Linton, looking out of the door; ""I wonder if they won't give him a headache."" ""They look like a foal's mane over his eyes!"" He ventured this remark without any intention of offense; but Heathcliff's aggressive nature did not expect any appearance of impertinence from one whom, even at this time, he seemed to hate as a rival."
"He grabbed a tureen of hot applesauce (the first thing that upset him) and hurled it with all his might into the speaker's face and throat. He immediately began to wail, whereupon Isabella and Catherine rushed over. Mr. Earnshaw immediately seized the offender and led him to his room, where he undoubtedly administered some brutal remedy to calm his anger, for he was red and out of breath. I grabbed the rag and rubbed Edgar's nose and mouth with some force to reassure him that he had every right to intervene."
"Her sister began to cry to get home, and Cathy stood there, astonished and blushing before everyone. ""You shouldn't have spoken to him!"" she protested to Master Linton. ""He was in a bad mood, and now you've spoiled your visit; and he's being whipped: I hate being whipped! I can't finish my supper. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?"" ""I didn't speak to him,"" sobbed the young man, slipping from me and finishing the rest of his toilette with his cambric handkerchief. ""I promised Mother I wouldn't say a word to him, and I didn't."" ""Come on, don't cry,"" replied Catherine contemptuously; ""you haven't been killed. Don't make another fuss; my brother is coming: Be quiet! Quiet, Isabella! Has anyone hurt you?"" ""Come, come, children, to your places!"" cried Hindley, as he entered. “The strong boy warmed me up wonderfully.”"
"Next time, take matters into your own hands, Master Edgar. You'll be hungry! The small group recovered at the sight of the fragrant feast. They were hungry after their ride and could easily console themselves because they were all right. Mr. Earnshaw opened plenty of plates, and the lady entertained them with lively conversation."
"I waited behind her chair and watched with a heavy heart as Catherine, dry-eyed and indifferent, began clipping a goose's wing right in front of her. ""What an insensitive child!"" I thought; ""How she ignores her former playmate's concerns! I never knew she could be so selfish."" She raised a bite to her lips and then put it down again. Her cheeks flushed, and tears streamed down. She dropped her fork to the floor and hastily slipped under the rug to hide her feelings."
"It didn't take long for me to convince her that she was unconscious. I had noticed that she had spent the entire day in Purgatory, longing for an opportunity to fly alone or visit Heathcliff, who had been imprisoned by the Lord. I realized this when I tried to arrange a private dinner for him. That evening, we danced. Cathy pleaded for his release, as Isabella Linton had no partner. Her pleas were in vain, and I was tasked with making up for the shortfall."
"The excitement of the exercise dispelled our despondency, and our joy was further enhanced by the arrival of Gimmerton's Band, a fifteen-piece ensemble including trumpets, trombones, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and bass viols, as well as singers. They visit all the wealthy homes every Christmas and receive gifts, and it was a joy to listen to them. After the usual Christmas carols, we sang our songs and were merry."
"Mrs. Earnshaw loved music, so they gave us plenty. Catherine liked it too, but she said it was better at the top of the stairs, so she went up in the dark. I followed her. They closed the ground floor door without noticing we were gone; there were so many people there."
"She didn't stay at the top of the stairs, but went up to the attic, where Heathcliff was locked, and called him. He stubbornly refused to answer for a while; she persisted and finally persuaded him to pray with her through the boards. I left the poor creatures chatting quietly until I guessed the singing was about to stop and the singers would have something to eat and drink; then I climbed the ladder to warn them."
"But instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice inside. The little monkey had crawled through the skylight of one attic, across the roof, and then up into the roof of the other, and with great difficulty, I managed to get her out. When she finally arrived, Heathcliff accompanied her and insisted that I take her into the kitchen, as my colleague had gone next door to escape the noise of our ""devil's song,"" as he called it."
"I told them I had no intention of supporting their plans, but since the prisoner hadn't fasted since the previous day's dinner, I would wink at his treacherous Mr. Hindley this once. He lay down. I placed a stool by the fire and offered him many delicacies, but he felt sick and ate little, and my attempts to distract him failed. He leaned back, resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands, sank into silent meditation."
"When I asked him what he was thinking about, he replied seriously: ""I'm thinking about how to thank Hindley. It doesn't matter how long I wait, as long as I finally get there. I hope he doesn't die before I do!"" ""Shame on you, Heathcliff!"" I said. ""It is God's duty to punish the wicked; we must learn to forgive."" ""No, God won't feel as much satisfaction as I do,"" he replied. ""I wish I knew the best way! Leave me alone, I'll take care of it. While I'm thinking about it, I feel no pain."" ""But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget that these stories won't distract you."""
"It annoys me that I can babble on so long; and your porridge is cold, and you fall asleep to go to bed! I could have told you the story of Heathcliff, all you needed, in half a dozen words. The housekeeper stopped, stood up, and laid down her needlework; but I felt unable to get up from the fire, and was far from nodding my head. ""Be quiet, Mrs. Dean!"" I cried; ""Be quiet for another half hour. You have told the story perfectly. That's how I like it; and you must finish it the same way."""
"I'm more or less interested in each of the characters you mentioned. — It's eleven o'clock, sir. — Never mind, I don't usually go to bed late at night. An hour or two is quite early for someone who sleeps until ten. — You shouldn't go to bed before ten. It's already past morning."
"Anyone who hasn't completed half their day's work by ten o'clock runs the risk of leaving the other half undone. ""Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, sit down again; for tomorrow I intend to prolong the night until noon. I certainly predict a persistent cold."" ""I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to be absent for about three years; in the meantime, Mrs. Earnshaw—"" ""No, no, I won't tolerate any such thing! Do you know in what state of mind you would be, if you were sitting alone, with the cat licking its kittens on the carpet before you, watching the operation with such attention that it would seriously bother you if the cat neglected even one ear?"" ""A terribly lazy state of mind, I should say."" ""On the contrary, a tedious task."""
"That's my concern at the moment; so I'll go into detail. I notice that the people of these regions value the inhabitants of the cities as much as a spider in a dungeon values a spider in a hut, their various inhabitants; and yet this heightened attractiveness is not entirely due to the position of observer. They live more seriously, more inwardly, and less focused on superficial, changeable, and frivolous external things."
"I had almost imagined a love here that would last a lifetime; and of a love that would last a whole year, I was a fervent skeptic. It is like serving a hungry man a single dish on which he can concentrate his entire appetite and give himself up to it completely; it is like leading him to a table laid by French cooks: he may perhaps derive equal pleasure from the whole; but each part is only an atom in his eyes and in his memory. ""Oh! We are like anywhere else here, once you get to know us,"" remarked Mrs. Dean, somewhat surprised by my speech. ""Excuse me,"" I replied; ""you, my dear friend, are a striking proof of the contrary. Apart from a few slight touches of provincialism, you show no trace of the manners I consider characteristic of your class."""
"I'm sure you've thought far more than most servants imagine. You've been forced to develop your mind because you've had no opportunity to waste your life on trivialities."" Mrs. Dean laughed. ""I certainly consider myself a sensible and judicious person,"" she said; ""not precisely because I live in the mountains and see the same faces and actions year after year; but I have maintained a strict discipline that has made me wise; and besides, I've read more than you think, Mr. Lockwood. You couldn't open a book in this library without my consulting and taking out something from it, unless it were Greek, Latin, and French; and I can do both: you can't expect more from a poor man's daughter."""
"But if I want to follow my narrative like a real chatterbox, I'd better continue; and instead of skipping three years, I'll simply jump to the following summer, the summer of 1778, almost 23 years ago. On a fine June day, my first beautiful little baby, and the last of the old Earnshaw line, was born. We were working hay in a distant field when the girl who usually brought us breakfast came running across the meadow and up the path an hour early and called to me. ""Oh, what a beautiful child!"" she gasped. ""The most beautiful boy that ever lived! But the doctor says the lady must go. He says she's been suffering from tuberculosis for months. I heard him say to Mr. Hindley, ""And now she has nothing to eat and will die before winter."""
"You must go home immediately. You must take care of her, Nelly: give her sugar and milk and look after her day and night. I wish I were in your place, because she will be all yours when there is no woman left! ""But is she really sick?"" I asked, throwing down my rake and fastening my hood. ""I think so; but she looks brave,"" replied the girl, ""and she talks as if she dreams of seeing her as a man one day."""
"She's overjoyed, what a beauty! If I were her, I certainly wouldn't die: the mere sight of her would heal me, despite Kenneth. I was furious at him. Lady Archer led the angel to the master of the house, and her face began to glow as the old prophet of doom stepped forward and said, ""Earnshaw, it's a blessing that your wife was spared and left you this son."""
"When she arrived, I was convinced we wouldn't have her long; and now I must tell you, the winter will probably exhaust her. Don't worry too much, don't worry too much: it's just the way it is. And besides, you should have known you wouldn't choose such a pretty girl! ""And what did the professor answer?"" I asked. ""I think he cursed, but that didn't bother me; I was so eager to see the child."" And she enthusiastically began her story all over again."
"Impatient as she was, I rushed home to admire it, though I felt very sorry for Hindley. In his heart, he had room for only two idols: his wife and himself. He cherished them both and worshipped one, and I couldn't imagine how he would cope with the loss. When we arrived at Wuthering Heights, he was standing in the doorway; and as we entered, I asked him, ""How has the baby been?"" ""Almost ready to run about, Nell!"" he replied with a cheerful smile. ""And the lady of the house?"" I ventured to ask. ""The doctor says she—"" ""Damn the doctor!"" he interrupted, blushing. ""Frances is quite right: she'll be better next week."""
"Will you come up? Will you tell her I'll come if she promises not to say anything? I left her because she refused to be silent; and she must tell her that Mr. Kenneth has commanded her to be silent. I carried this news to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed cheerful and answered cheerfully, ""I have hardly said a word, Ellen, and now twice he has gone away crying. Now, tell him I promise not to say anything; but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!"" Poor soul! For a week after his death, she did not leave that cheerful heart; and her husband stubbornly, even angrily, maintained that her health was daily improving."
"When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at this stage of the illness and that he shouldn't cost her any more, he replied: ""I know you don't need them; she's well; she doesn't need your care anymore! She never had tuberculosis. It was a fever, and that's gone: her pulse is now as slow as mine, and her cheek is just as cold."" He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one evening, as she leaned on his shoulder and said she thought she would be able to get up the next day, a slight cough came over her. He lifted her in his arms; she clasped her hands around his neck, her face changed, and she died. As the little girl had expected, little Hareton fell completely into my hands."
"Mr. Earnshaw, for his part, was content, as long as he saw him well and never heard him cry. He himself was in despair; his grief was so great that it surpassed all complaint. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied; he cursed God and man and indulged in unbridled debauchery."
"The servants couldn't tolerate his tyrannical and evil behavior for long: Joseph and I were the only ones who wanted to stay. I couldn't bring myself to leave my post; besides, I had been his foster sister and, as a stranger, I was more likely to excuse his behavior. Joseph stayed to harass the peasants and workers; and because it was his calling to be where he had much evil to condemn."
"The Master's bad manners and bad friends set a good example for Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was so bad that he could transform a demon into a saint. And indeed, the boy did seem to have something diabolical about him at the time."
"It gave him great pleasure to see Hindley humiliated beyond saving; and his barbaric sullenness and cruelty became more noticeable every day. I could hardly imagine the hell that reigned in our house. The minister canceled his visit, and eventually no one visited us anymore, except for Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy."
"At fifteen, she was the queen of the land; she was incomparable and proved to be a haughty and willful lady! I confess that after my childhood, I disliked her and often annoyed her by trying to curb her arrogance; but she never hated me. Their old ties were of wonderful constancy: even Heathcliff retained his unwavering affection; and young Linton, for all his superiority, found it difficult to make such an impression. He was my old man; there hangs his portrait over the fireplace."
"It used to hang on one side and his wife's on the other; but his was taken down, otherwise it would have been visible. Do you see it? Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I saw a face with soft features, very like the young woman in The Heights, but with a more thoughtful and gentle expression. It was a pretty picture."
"Her long, fair hair, slightly curled at the temples, her large, serious eyes, her almost too graceful figure. It didn't surprise me that Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first boyfriend for such a person. On the other hand, I was surprised to see how, with his desire to please himself, he could shape the image I had of Catherine Earnshaw. ""A very pleasing portrait,"" I remarked to the housekeeper. ""Is that true?"" ""Yes,"" she replied; ""but he was most handsome when lively; that is his everyday appearance: he generally needed a lively air."" Catherine had kept in touch with the Lintons since her five weeks' stay with them; and, not tempted to be rude in their company, and ashamed to be impolite in the face of such unfailing courtesy, she unconsciously impressed the old lady and the old gentleman with her resourceful cordiality. had won Isabella's admiration and her brother's heart and soul: qualities that flattered her from the start – after all, she was full of ambition – and that led her to adopt a dual character, with no particular intention of deceiving anyone."
"When she heard Heathcliff described as a ""common young villain"" and ""worse than a beast,"" she took care not to behave like him; at home, however, she was little inclined to civilities that would only provoke ridicule, nor to temper a fractious temper that would bring her neither honor nor praise. Mr. Edgar seldom found the courage to go openly to Wuthering Heights. Terrified by Earnshaw's reputation, he shrank from meeting him; yet he was always received with the utmost courtesy: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing his intentions; and when he could not be civil, he kept aloof."
"I rather think that his presence was distasteful to Catherine; she was not clever, never played the coquette, and was definitely against the meeting of her two friends. For when Heathcliff expressed contempt for Linton in her presence, she could not bear it as half-heartedly as she did in his absence; and when Linton showed loathing and antipathy for Heathcliff, she dared not treat him indifferently, as if he cared little for his playmate's contempt. I have often laughed at her indescribable perplexity and perturbation, which she vainly endeavored to conceal from my ridicule. It seems cruel, but she was so proud that it became impossible for her to sympathize with his grief until she was brought to greater humility."
"Finally, she decided to confess her life to me and confide in me: she had no one else to turn to. Mr. Hindley had left home one afternoon, and Heathcliff had taken a holiday. He was, I believe, sixteen at the time, and without any unattractive features or lack of intelligence, he gave an impression of inner and outer repulsion of which his present appearance leaves no trace."
"First of all, he had lost the advantages of his early education: hard and constant work, beginning early and finishing late, had robbed him of all curiosity, all love of books and learning. The sense of superiority of his youth, instilled in him by the favor of old Mr. Earnshaw, was gone. For a long time he struggled to keep pace with Catherine's studies and gave up with deep, though silent, regret. But he gave himself up entirely; and nothing could induce him to go a step further when he found that he must necessarily fall behind his former level."
"Then his appearance was accompanied by a mental deterioration: he assumed a slow gait and an unworthy countenance; his natural reserve increased to an almost idiotic excess of antisocial melancholy; and he evidently took a malicious delight in exciting disgust rather than respect in his few acquaintances. He and Catherine were still his constant companions during his recesses; but he had ceased to express his affection for her in words and recoiled with furious distrust from her filial caresses, as if he knew that it would give her no satisfaction to lavish him with such marks of affection. On the occasion above mentioned, he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while I helped Miss Cathy to dress. She had not expected that he would think of being lazy; and, thinking she had the whole house to herself, she somehow managed to inform Mr. Edgar of his brother's absence and then prepared to receive him. ""Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?"" asked Heathcliff. ""Are you going anywhere?"" ""No, it's raining,"" she replied. ""Then why are you wearing that silk dress?"" he asked. ""I hope no one comes here?"" ""Not that I know of,"" stammered Miss. ""But you ought to be out in the fields, Heathcliff."""
"It's one o'clock after dinner: I thought you weren't here. ""Hindley doesn't often get rid of her accursed presence,"" the boy remarked. ""I have the day off: I'll stay with you."" ""Oh, but Joseph will tell you,"" she suggested; ""you'd better go! Joseph is loading lime from the other side of Penistone Crags; he'll be there all night and never know."" With that, he strolled to the fire and sat down. Catherine thought for a moment and frowned; she felt an urge to let an intruder pass. ""Isabella and Edgar Linton have been talking about coming this afternoon,"" she said after a minute's silence. ""On account of the rain, I don't expect them; but they might come, and if they do, you might be scolded for nothing."" ""Tell Ellen you're engaged, Cathy,"" he persisted. ""Don't exclude me from your miserable, idiotic list of friends!"" Sometimes I feel like complaining that she—but I don't—' 'That she—what?' cried Catherine, looking at him anxiously. 'Oh, Nelly!' she added irritably, pulling her head away from my hands, 'you tore up my curls while combing them! That's enough; leave me alone. What are you complaining about, Heathcliff?' 'Nothing—look at the almanac on the wall,' he said, pointing to a framed sheet hanging in the window, and continued: 'The crosses represent the evenings you spent with the Lintons, the dots those you spent with me.'"
"You see? I've been writing it down every day.' 'Yes, silly indeed: as if I noticed!' answered Catherine sullenly. 'And what's the point of that?' 'To show that I do notice,' said Heathcliff. 'And must I always sit by your side?' she demanded, growing more and more irritated. 'What's the point of that? What are you talking about? You must be a fool, or a child, with all the things you say to amuse me, or all the things you do!' 'You never told me that I don't talk enough, or that you don't like my company, Cathy!' cried Heathcliff excitedly. 'It isn't company at all when people don't know and don't say,' she murmured. Her companion rose, but he had no time to express his feelings further, for the sound of horse's hooves on the flagstones, and after a light knock, young Linton entered, his face beaming with joy at the unexpected visit she had received. Catherine undoubtedly noticed the difference between her friends, for one came in and the other left."
"The contrast was like exchanging a desolate, hilly mining area for a beautiful, fertile valley; his voice and greeting were as contradictory as his appearance. He had a soft, deep voice and spoke his words as one might: less abruptly than here, and more gently. ""Haven't I come too early?"" he said, glancing at me. I had begun drying my plate and tidying some drawers on the other side of the dresser. ""No,"" Catherine replied. ""What are you doing here, Nelly?"" ""My work, miss,"" I replied. (Mr. Hindley had asked me to have a third person assist during Linton's private visits.) She stood behind me and whispered angrily, ""Take off your clothes and dusters; when there are people in the house, the servants don't start scrubbing and cleaning the room they're in!"" ""This is a good opportunity, now that the master is gone,"" I replied loudly. ""He can't stand it when I argue about such things in his presence. Mr. Edgar will surely forgive me."" ""I can't stand it when you argue in my presence,"" the young woman cried imperiously, without giving her guest a moment to speak. Since her little quarrel with Heathcliff, she hadn't been able to regain her composure. ""I'm sorry, Miss Catherine,"" I replied, diligently continuing with my work."
"Thinking Edgar didn't see her, she tore the handkerchief from my hands and squeezed my arm long and hard. I told her I didn't love her and sometimes even enjoyed wounding her vanity; besides, she hurt me terribly. Then I jumped up and cried, ""Oh, miss, this is a dirty trick! You have no right to bite me, and I won't tolerate it."" ""I didn't touch you, you liar!"" she cried, her fingers tingling at the thought of repeating it, and her ears red with rage. She had never succeeded in concealing her passion; it always burned within her. ""What is it?"" I replied, with a determined, purple witness to refute her."
"She stamped her foot, hesitated for a moment, and then, irresistibly driven by her inner malice, struck me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with tears. ""Catherine, my dear! Catherine!"" Linton interrupted, deeply shaken by his idol's double error of falsehood and violence. ""Get out of the room, Ellen!"" she repeated, trembling all over. Little Hareton, who had followed me everywhere and sat on the floor beside me, began to cry at the sight of my tears and complained about ""wicked Aunt Cathy,"" which brought his anger to his unhappy face. She seized him by the shoulders and shook him until the poor child was as white as chalk, and Edgar, without thinking, seized his hands to free him. In an instant, one of them came loose, and the young man was astonished to feel it brush against his ear in a way that could not be interpreted as a joke."
"He recoiled in alarm. I took Hareton in my arms and accompanied him into the kitchen. I left the connecting door open, curious to see how they would resolve their argument. The offended visitor, pale and with trembling lips, approached the spot where he had left his hat. ""Seriously!"" I said to myself. ""Warn me and get out of here! It's a nice gesture to give you a glimpse of his true self."" ""Where are you going?"" Catherine asked, heading for the door."
"He dodged and tried to get past her. ""You mustn't go!"" she cried forcefully. ""I must!"" he answered softly. ""No,"" she insisted, tightening the latch, ""not yet, Edgar Linton. Sit down, you mustn't leave me like this. I'll be miserable all night, and I won't do that to you!"" ""Can I stay after you hit me?"" Linton asked. Catherine was speechless. ""You frightened and shamed me,"" he continued. ""I'm not coming back here!"" Her eyes began to sparkle and her eyelids glitter. ""And you lied on purpose!"" he said. ""That wasn't me!"" she cried, finding her voice. ""I didn't do anything on purpose."""
"Go away, please go away! And now I'm crying, crying my eyes out! She fell to her knees beside a chair and began to cry, in all seriousness. Edgar held out until the tribunal; he stayed there for a while. I decided to encourage him. ""Mademoiselle is terribly stubborn, sir,"" I cried. ""As bad as a deformed child: you'd better go home, or she'll get sick and make us sad."" The friendly creature looked questioningly out the window: he had the power to leave, just as a cat has the power to leave a mouse half-dead or a bird half-eaten."
"Ah! I thought, he is beyond saving: he is damned and running to his doom! And so it happened: he turned abruptly, rushed back, and closed the door behind him; and when I returned a moment later to report that Earnshaw had come home drunk and ready to spill all about us (his usual state of mind under such circumstances), I saw that this quarrel had only increased their intimacy, shattered the facade of their youthful timidity, and enabled them to abandon their friendship and confess themselves as lovers. The news of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton to his horse and Catherine to her room. I went, hid little Hareton, and fetched the lead from the master's hunting harness, which in his wild excitement he played with so willingly, at the risk of anyone irritating him or even attracting him too much; and I had determined to take it off, that it might do less damage if it fired."
"He came in, cursing and cursing hideously in my ear, and surprised me hiding his son in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was seized with a wholesome fear at the thought of being exposed to the affection or the frenzied rage of his wild animal; for in the one case he would probably be crushed and kissed to death, in the other thrown into the fire or dashed against the wall; and the poor creature lay perfectly still wherever I laid it. ""There, I've found him at last!"" cried Hindley, pulling me by the scruff of the neck like a dog. ""By God and hell, you've conspired to kill that child! Now I know why he always avoids me. But with Satan's help, I'll make you swallow the knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh, because I just stuffed Kenneth headfirst into Black Horse Marsh; and two is one—and I intend to kill some of them: I won't rest until I've done it!"" ""But I don't like the carving knife, Mr. Hindley,"" I replied; ""that's a red herring."""
"""I'd rather be shot, if that's all right with you."" ""You'd rather be damned!"" he said; ""and you will. No law in England can prevent a man from running his house decently, and mine is abominable! Open your mouth."" He had the knife in his hand and rammed the point between my teeth. But I had never been particularly afraid of his caprices. I spat it out, protesting that it tasted disgusting—I would not take it under any circumstances. ""Oh!"" he said, letting go of me, ""I see that horrible little villain is not Hareton. Forgive me, Nell."""
"If so, he deserves to be skinned alive for not running up to me screaming like I was a goblin. Little Denature, come here! I'll show you how to charm a good-natured and misguided father. Don't you think the boy would look better with a haircut? It makes a dog look wilder, and I like wilder things—give me some scissors—something wilder and tidier! Besides, it's a hellish invention—a devilish vanity—to pamper one's ears—we're stupid enough without them."
"Hush, child, hush! Come, my darling! I wish you could dry your tears—what joy! Kiss me. What? Won't you? Kiss me, Hareton! Lord, kiss me! By God, as if I'd wake such a monster! As sure as I live, I'll break its neck. Poor Hareton howled and kicked with all his might in his father's arms, and screamed even louder as I carried him upstairs and over the banister. I screamed that he frightened the child, and I ran to save him."
"As I reached them, Hindley leaned over the railing to listen for a noise below; he had almost forgotten what he was holding. ""Who's there?"" he asked, hearing someone approaching the stairs. I, too, leaned forward and signaled to Heathcliff, whose footsteps I recognized, to stop. But no sooner had I taken my eyes off Hareton than he suddenly jumped up, freed himself from the casual grasp, and fell. We barely had time to shudder in horror when we saw that the little wreck was safe and sound."
"Heathcliff arrived at the right moment; with a natural movement, he arrested his fall, stood up, and looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has sold a lottery ticket for five shillings and finds the next day he has lost five thousand pounds could not wear a more gloomy face than at the sight of Mr. Earnshaw's figure looming over him. More clearly than words, it expressed the deepest fear of having been used as an instrument to thwart his own revenge."
"Had it been dark, he would surely have tried to redeem himself by smashing Hareton's skull on the stairs. But we witnessed his rescue. Soon I was downstairs, clutching my precious burden to my heart. Hindley came down calmer, more sober, and more ashamed. ""It's your fault, Ellen,"" he said. ""You should have hidden him. You should have taken him away from me! Is he hurt anywhere?"" ""Hurt!"" I cried angrily. ""If he isn't killed, he's a fool! Oh! I wonder his mother doesn't rise from the grave to see how you treat him. You are worse than a heathen, treating your own flesh and blood thus!"" He tried to touch the child, who, upon finding herself near me, immediately began to sob to drive away her fear."
"But at the first finger his father touched, he screamed again, even louder than before, and writhed as if in convulsions. ""Don't worry about him!"" I continued. ""He hates you—everyone hates you—that's the truth! You have a happy family and you're well!"" ""I'll get better, Nelly,"" laughed the battered man, his hardness returning. ""Now go with him and you. And listen, Heathcliff! Get out of my sight and ears, too. I wouldn't kill you tonight unless I set fire to the house. But this is my idea."" As he said this, he took half a pint of brandy from the dresser and poured it into a glass. ""No, no!"" I pleaded. ""Mr. Hindley, be warned."""
"""Pity this unfortunate fellow if you don't look after yourself!"" ""Anyone will look after him better than I,"" he replied. ""Pity your own soul!"" I said, trying to snatch the glass from his hand. ""Not I! On the contrary, it will be a great pleasure for me to send him to damnation as punishment for his Creator,"" cried the blasphemer. ""To his damnation!"" He drank the liquor and impatiently ordered us to leave; his command ended with a string of hideous curses too terrible to repeat or memorize. ""It's a pity he can't drink himself to death,"" remarked Heathcliff, muttering an echo of imprecations as the door closed. ""He does his best, but his constitution defies him."" ""Mr. Kenneth said he would bet his mare that she would outlive everyone this side of Gimmerton and go to the grave a gray-haired sinner; unless some lucky chance befell her, that is not her way. I went into the kitchen and sat down to put my lamb to sleep. Heathcliff, I thought, went into the barn."
"It turned out he hadn't left the cottage yet, as he threw himself onto a bench by the wall, away from the fire, and remained silent. I rocked Hareton on my knees and hummed a song that began, ""It was late at night, and the children were wailing."" The mother under the hats heard it when Miss Cathy, who had been listening to the commotion from her room, poked her head in and whispered, ""Are you alone, Nelly?"" ""Yes, miss,"" I answered. She went inside and walked to the fireplace."
"I thought she was going to say something, so I looked up. Her expression seemed troubled and worried. Her lips were parted, as if she were about to say something, and she took a deep breath, but it wasn't a sentence, it was a sigh."
"I resumed my song; I hadn't forgotten her behavior. ""Where is Heathcliff?"" she interrupted. ""Because of his work in the stable,"" I replied. He didn't contradict me; perhaps he had fallen asleep. There was a long silence, during which I saw a drop or two trickle down Catherine's cheek and onto the flagstones."
"Does she regret her shameful behavior? I wondered. It will be something new: but she could—and she will—I won't help her! No, she had nothing to fear except her own worries. ""Oh dear!"" she cried at last. ""I am very unhappy!"" ""What a pity,"" I remarked. ""You are difficult to please; so many friends and so few worries, and you can't manage to please yourself!"" ""Nelly, will you keep a secret from me?"" she continued, kneeling beside me and raising her enchanting eyes to me, the kind that drives away bad moods even when one has every right to do so. ""Is it worth it?"" I asked, less sullenly. ""Yes, and it worries me, and I must say so! I want to know what to do."" Today Edgar Linton proposed to me, and I said yes."
"Now, before I tell you whether it was approval or refusal, tell me what it should have been. ""Really, Miss Catherine, how should I know?"" I replied. ""Of course, considering the performance you made in his presence this afternoon, I should say it would be wise to decline: since he asked you about it, he must be either hopelessly stupid or a brazen fool."" ""If you talk like that, I'll tell you no more,"" she replied, rising sullenly. ""I accepted it, Nelly. Come, tell me if I was wrong!"" ""You accepted it! What's the use talking about it then? You've given your word and you can't go back on it."" ""But tell me if I should have!"" she cried irritably, rubbing her hands and frowning. ""There is much to consider before I can answer that question properly,"" I said pompously. ""Do you love Mr. Edgar?"" ""Who can stop me? Of course I do,"" she replied. Then I gave her the following catechism: For a twenty-two-year-old girl, that wasn't unreasonable. ""Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?"" ""Everything, I love him, that's enough."" ""Not at all; you must tell me why?"" ""Well, because he's handsome and a pleasure to be with."" ""Bad!"" I was about to reply. ""And because he's young and cheerful."" ""Still bad."" ""And because he loves me."" ""Never mind, I'll get there."" ""And he'll be rich, and I'll be happy to be the most respected woman in the neighborhood, and I'll be proud of such a husband."" ""The worst of all."""
"And now tell me, how do you love him? – Just as everyone loves him... You're crazy, Nelly. – Not at all... Answer me. – I love the earth beneath his feet, the air above his head, everything he touches, every word he says. I love every look in his eyes, every action, and everything about him. Right there! – And why? – No, you're joking: that's extremely wicked! It's no joke to me! said the young woman, frowning, and turning her face to the fire. – I'm not joking, Miss Catherine, I replied. You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, young, cheerful, rich, and loves you."
"This last point, however, is unnecessary: you would probably love him without him; and not with him either, unless he possessed the four preceding charms.—No, certainly not: I should only pity him, or even hate him, if he were ugly and a clown.—But there are other handsome and rich young men in the world: perhaps more handsome and rich than he. What should prevent you from loving them?—If there are, I avoid them: I never saw one like Edgar.—Perhaps you will be; and he will not always be handsome and young, and perhaps not always rich either.—He is now; and I have only to think about the present. I wish you would speak sensibly.—Well, that is all: if you only think about the present, marry Mr. Linton.—I need not ask your leave for that; I will marry her: and yet you have not told me whether I was right.—Quite right; if one marries only for the present."
"And now tell us what makes you unhappy. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and the old man, I think, won't mind; you'll be leaving a chaotic and dreary house for a rich and decent one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. Everything seems simple and easy: where is the obstacle? ""HERE! And HERE!"" replied Katharina, striking her forehead with one hand and her chest with the other: ""Wherever the soul dwells."""
"Deep in my soul and heart, I am convinced I am wrong! – It is very strange! I cannot understand it. – It is my secret. But if you will not laugh at me, I will explain it to you: I cannot explain it exactly; but I will give you an idea of what I feel. She sat down beside me again; her face became sadder and more serious, and her clasped hands trembled. – Nelly, do you never have strange dreams? she said suddenly, after thinking for a few minutes. – Yes, from time to time, I answered. And I do too. In my life, I have had dreams that have always marked me and changed my thoughts: they have passed through me as wine through water, changing the color of my mind."
"And here's one: I'll tell it, but beware of smiling at him. ""Oh! Don't, Miss Catherine!"" I cried. ""We are sad enough without having to trouble ourselves with specters and visions. Come, come, be merry and be yourselves! Look at little Hareton! He has no dark dreams. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!"" ""Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his loneliness! You remember him, no doubt, when he was just as plump as this thing: almost as young and innocent."""
"But Nelly, I'll force you to listen to me. It won't be long, and tonight I lack the strength to be cheerful. ""I won't listen to her, I won't listen to her!"" I repeated hastily. ""I was superstitious about dreams then, and I still am. And Catherine had an unusual sadness that made me fear something from which I might draw a prophecy and foretell a terrible catastrophe."" She was annoyed, but she didn't pursue it further."
"Apparently she changed the subject, because she immediately continued: ""If I were in Heaven, Nelly, I would be terribly unhappy."" ""Because you weren't made for it,"" I replied. ""All sinners would be unhappy in Heaven."" ""But that's not true. I once dreamed I was there."" ""I tell you, I don't listen to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'm going to bed,"" I interrupted again. She laughed and hugged me tightly, for I made to get up. ""It's nothing,"" she cried. ""I only meant that Heaven didn't seem to be my home; and I was moved to tears when I came back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they threw me down among the heather on the top of Wuthering Heights, where I woke up sobbing with joy."""
"That explains my secret, as well as the other. I have no reason to marry Edgar Linton, any more than there is in heaven; and if that vile man hadn't wounded Heathcliff so deeply, I wouldn't have thought of it. It would be humiliating for me to marry Heathcliff now; he'll never know how much I love him: and that's not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more like me than I am."
"Whatever our souls may be, his and mine are identical; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire. Before I had even finished this speech, I felt Heathcliff's presence. I noticed a slight movement, turned my head, and saw him rise from the sofa and walk away in silence. He had listened until Catherine said that marrying her would humiliate him, and then he stood there and listened no more."
"My companion was sitting on the floor and couldn't notice his presence or departure through the arm of the sofa. I jumped up and told her to be quiet! ""Why?"" she asked, looking around nervously. ""Joseph is here,"" I replied, hearing the rumble of his wheels on the street at just the right moment. ""And Heathcliff is coming in with him. I'm not sure he isn't standing at the door right now."" ""Oh, he didn't hear me at the door!"" she said. ""Give me Hareton while you prepare dinner, and when it's ready, invite me to dinner. I want to ease my guilty conscience and convince myself that Heathcliff knows nothing about such things."""
"Hasn't he, has he? He doesn't know what it is to be in love! 'I see no reason why he shouldn't, just as you do,' I replied. 'And if he chooses you, he will be the unhappiest creature that ever lived! The moment you are Mrs. Linton, he will lose his friend, his love, and everything! Have you considered how you will bear the separation, and how he will bear being utterly abandoned to the world? For, Miss Catherine—' 'He is utterly deserted! We are separated!' she cried indignantly. 'Who will, pray, separate us? You will suffer the same fate as Milo! Not in my lifetime, Ellen: not for any mortal being. All the Lintons on earth may vanish before I consent to leave Heathcliff. Oh, I don't mean that, I don't mean that!' I wouldn't be Mrs. Linton if such a price were exacted from me! He will mean as much to me as he did his entire life."
"Edgar must put aside his dislike and at least tolerate him. He will do so when he learns my true feelings for him. Nelly, I see now that you think me a selfish villain; but has it never occurred to you that we would be beggars if Heathcliff and I were married? If I married Linton, I could help Heathcliff to his feet and free him from my brother's grasp. ""With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?"" I asked. ""You will find him not as docile as you think; and though I find it difficult to judge, I consider this the worst reason you ever gave for becoming young Linton's wife."" ""It is not,"" she replied, ""it is the best! The others were the gratification of my caprices, and also for Edgar's sake, to appease him."""
"This is for someone who understands my feelings for Edgar and myself personally. I cannot express them in words; but surely you, like everyone else, believe that there is, or should be, an existence outside yourself? What would my creation have been of use if I had been entirely absorbed in it? My greatest misfortune in this world was Heathcliff's misfortune, and I have experienced and felt them all from the beginning: my greatest thought in life is him."
"If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still exist; and if all else remained, and HE were destroyed, the universe were turned into a mighty stranger: I should not belong to it.—My love for Linton is like the leaves of the wood: time will change it, I know, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff is like the eternal rocks that cover it: a source of seemingly small joy, but necessary none the less. Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He is always, always on my mind: not as a joy, any more than I am always a joy to myself, but as my own being."
"Then speak no more of our separation: it is impracticable; and—"" She paused and buried her face in the folds of my dress; but I tore it violently. My patience with her nonsense was at an end! ""If I can understand your nonsense, Mademoiselle,"" I said, ""it only convinces me that you do not know the duties you assume in marriage; or that you are a wicked and unscrupulous girl. But do not burden me with further secrets: I do not promise to keep them."" ""Will you keep them?"" she asked eagerly. ""No, I do not promise,"" I repeated."
"She wanted to insist, but Joseph's arrival interrupted our conversation. Catherine pushed her chair into a corner and looked after Hareton while I prepared dinner. When the meal was ready, my colleague and I began to discuss who should take what to Mr. Hindley; and we were only able to settle the matter when everything was almost cold. Then we agreed to ask him if he wanted anything, as we felt particularly brave enough to speak to him after a while of solitude. ""And how can he not be back from the field yet? What is he doing? He's dirty!"" asked the old man, looking for Heathcliff. ""I'll call him,"" I replied. ""He's in the barn, I'm sure of it."" I tried to call him, but received no answer."
"When I returned, I whispered to Catherine that he must have heard much of what she had said. And I told him how I had seen him coming out of the kitchen just as she was complaining about her brother's behavior. She flinched, threw Hareton onto the sofa, and ran off to find her friend. She gave no thought to her excitement or to the effect her words might have had on him. She had been gone so long that Joseph thought they shouldn't wait any longer."
"He had a sneaking suspicion that they were wandering off to avoid his long and drawn-out benediction. ""That was enough for a few discourtesies,"" he claimed. And for them, that evening, he added a special prayer to the usual fifteen minutes of supplication before dinner, and he would have added another at the end, had not his young mistress surprised him by hastily bidding him go down the road and find Heathcliff, wherever he might have gone, and bring him back at once! ""I want to speak to him, and I MUST before I go up,"" she said. ""And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of earshot; for he has not answered, though I called with all my might from the sheepfold."" Joseph protested at first; but she was too earnest to be contradicted; and at last he put on his hat and muttered."
"Meanwhile, Catherine paced the room, crying. ""Where is he? Where could he possibly be? What did I say, Nelly? I've forgotten. Did my bad temper upset him this afternoon? My dear! Tell me, what did I say to hurt him? I wish he would come. I wish he would come!"" ""What a racket!"" I cried, though I was a little worried myself. ""What a terrible thing! There's no need to worry about Heathcliff running across the moor in the moonlight or being too grumpy to talk to us in the hayloft."""
"I'll wait for him there. Let's see if I can't find him! I resumed my search; the result was disappointment, and Joseph's ended the same way. ""That boy will have war and war!"" he remarked as he came in. ""He opened the gate, and Miss's pony lifted two rows of corn and climbed right through it, right into the middle of the field! Hahsomdiver, the master, will face hell on earth tomorrow, and he'll do well. He has patience even with such careless, filthy craters—what patience he has himself! But he won't be so hungry—you see, it's all yours! You won't get him out of your head for nothing!"" ""Have you found Heathcliff, donkey?"" interrupted Catherine. ""Have you looked for him as I ordered?"" ""I'd rather look for the horse,"" he replied. ""That would be more logical."""
"But I can find a Nordic horse, not quite so—as black as Chimbley! And Heathcliff, no, let the fellow come to my whistle, and he'll hear better with you! It was a very dark summer evening; the clouds seemed to be gathering into a storm, and I said we had better sit down; the approaching rain would surely bring him home without further trouble. Catherine, however, could not be pacified. She wandered restlessly from door to door, in a state of agitation that brooked no repose; and at last she settled down permanently on one side of the wall near the road: where, ignoring my warnings, the rumble of thunder and the large drops that began to patter around her, she called now and then, then listened, then cried aloud."
"She would have made Hareton, or any other child, burst into tears. Around midnight, while we were still awake, a storm broke out on the Heights. A fierce wind and thunder raged, and one of them tore a tree from the corner of the building; a huge branch fell on the roof and tore down part of the east chimney, throwing stones and soot into the kitchen fire."
"We thought lightning had struck us. Joseph fell to his knees and begged the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot and, as He had once done, to spare the righteous, even though He had struck down the wicked. I sensed that this must be a judgment for us as well. Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the door of his cave to see if he was still alive."
"He answered in a fairly audible voice, in a manner that made my companion scream even louder than before, so that it was possible to clearly distinguish saints like him from sinners like his master. But the commotion subsided after twenty minutes, and we all left unharmed, except for Cathy, who was soaked to the skin because she stubbornly refused to seek shelter and, without a hat or shawl, to collect as much water as possible in her hair and clothes. She went inside and lay down on the sofa, completely soaked, turned her face back, and placed her hands on it. ""Come on now, Miss!"" I cried, touching her shoulder. ""You're not here to die, are you? Do you know what time it is? Twelve thirty."""
"Come to bed! We needn't wait any longer for the damned boy: he's gone to Gimmerton and is staying there. He supposes we shouldn't expect him until this late hour; at least, he supposes only Mr. Hindley is still up; and he would rather the master hadn't opened the door. ""No, no, he's not at Gimmerton,"" said Joseph. ""No wonder he's sitting in the bog. This visit has been in vain, and I beg you, be careful, miss; you're next."""
"Thank you, Hivin, for everything! Cooperation is good for them, as it should be, and it's so easy! You know how to find the Scriptures."" And he began quoting various texts, telling us the chapters and verses where we could find them. After vainly pleading with the wayward girl to get up and take off her wet clothes, I left him preaching and trembling and went to bed with little Hareton, who fell asleep as soundly as if everyone around him were asleep. I heard Joseph reading further a little later; then I heard his slow footsteps on the ladder and fell asleep."
"Coming downstairs a little later than usual, I saw, by the rays of sunlight peeping through the cracks in the shutters, that Miss Catherine was still sitting by the fire. The front door was also ajar; the light fell through the open windows; Hindley had gone out and was standing, exhausted and sleepy, over the kitchen fire. ""What is the matter, Cathy?"" he asked as I came in. ""You look as gloomy as a drowned bear. Why are you so pale and wet, girl?"" ""I was wet,"" she answered reluctantly, ""and I'm cold, that's all."" ""Oh, she's naughty!"" I exclaimed, perceiving that the gentleman was sober. ""She was wet from the rain last night, and she lay there all night, and I couldn't shake her off."" Mr. Earnshaw looked at us in astonishment. ""All night,"" he repeated. ""What kept her awake? Surely not fear of thunder?"" That was hours ago. Neither of us wanted to mention Heathcliff's absence as long as we could hide it. So I replied, ""I don't know how she had the courage to sit up."" And she said nothing."
"The morning was fresh and clear; I opened the shutter, and soon the sweet scent of the garden filled the room. But Catherine called to me grumpily, ""Ellen, close the window! I'm starving!"" Her teeth chattered as she approached the almost extinguished embers. ""She's ill,"" said Hindley, taking her wrist. ""I suppose that's why she didn't want to go to bed. Damn it! I don't want any more sickness here."""
"What brought you out into the rain? ""You're running after those boys, like always!"" croaked Joseph, taking advantage of our hesitation to use his sharp tongue. ""If I were you, sir, I'd just smash them on the head with a plank! Not a day goes by when you're away without Linton's cat sneaking in; and Miss Nelly, she's a pretty girl! She waits for you in the kitchen; and when you go in by one door, he goes out by the other; and then our great lady is gone! What pretty behavior, creeping about the fields like this after midnight with that dirty, fawning gypsy Heathcliff! They take me for blind; but I'm a nobody: nothing to be exorcised!"" ""I see young Linton coming and going, and I see YAH (turning to me): 'YAH plays in vain, you careless witch!'"" ""Go quickly upstairs and rush into the house, just as you hear the master's horse rattle in the street."" ""Hush, you indiscreet woman!"" cried Catherine. ""Don't be so impertinent to me! Edgar Linton happened to be passing by yesterday, Hindley; and it was I who rebuked him, for I knew you would not have liked to see him thus."" ""You are lying, Cathy, I'm sure you are,"" replied her brother, ""and you are a damned fool! But leave Linton alone for a moment: Tell me, were you not at Heathcliff's last night? Tell the truth now. You needn't be afraid of hurting him. Although I hate him just as much, he recently did me a service that will give me remorse. To prevent that, I'll send him out this morning; and when he's gone, I advise you all to stay dry; then I'll be even funnier to you."" ""I didn't see Heathcliff last night,"" Catherine answered, beginning to sob bitterly, ""and if you send him out, I'll go with him."""
"But perhaps you will never have the opportunity; perhaps he has gone away."" Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the rest of her words were unintelligible. Hindley showered her with a torrent of contemptuous insults and ordered her to return to her room immediately, or she would not weep in vain! I forced her to obey, and I will never forget the sight she presented to us when she arrived in her room: it frightened me. I thought she was going mad and asked Joseph to send for the doctor."
"This was the beginning of a delirium: As soon as Mr. Kenneth saw her, he declared her gravely ill; she had a fever. He took her blood and told me to keep her alive with a porridge of whey and water and to make sure she didn't throw herself down the stairs or out of the window. Then he left; he had enough to do in the community, where the individual houses were usually three or four kilometers apart. Although I was not exactly a kind nurse, and Joseph and the Lord were no better, and our patient was as annoying and stubborn as one could be, she survived."
"Old Mrs. Linton visited us several times, correcting us, scolding us, and bossing us around. When Catherine recovered, she insisted on taking her to Thrushcross Grange, for which we were very grateful. But the poor lady had reason to regret her kindness: she and her husband both fell ill with a fever and died within a few days. Our young wife returned more impudent, passionate, and arrogant than ever."
"Since the stormy night, there had been no news of Heathcliff; and one day, after she had provoked me violently, I had the misfortune to blame her for his disappearance—in her place, as she knew only too well. From then on, and for several months, she had no further contact with me except as a simple servant. Joseph, too, fell under her spell: he told her what he thought and lectured her like a little girl; she considered herself a woman and our mistress and believed that her recent illness justified respectful treatment."
"The doctor had declared at the time that she would tolerate no great injustice; she must have her own way; and that in her eyes it was murder if anyone dared to contradict her. She kept her away from Mr. Earnshaw and his companions; and under Kenneth's guidance, and with stern threats that often accompanied his tantrums, her brother granted her all she wanted and generally avoided irritating her hot temper. He was rather indulgent in his indulgences; not from affection, but from pride: he ardently desired that she should do honor to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she left him alone, she could trample us all down like slaves, he cared little! Edgar Linton, like many before and after him, was madly in love: and he considered himself the happiest man in the world on the day he conducted her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years after her father's death."
"Very reluctantly, I allowed myself to be persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and accompany him here. Little Hareton was almost five years old, and I had only just begun to teach him to read. We said our goodbyes sadly, but Catherine's tears were stronger than ours. When I refused, seeing that her pleas did not move me, she went to her husband and brother with a sad face."
"The first offered me a generous salary; the second ordered me to leave: he wanted no more women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as for Hareton, the vicar would soon overpower him. So I had only one choice: to obey. I explained to the master that he wanted to get rid of all honest people in order to ruin himself even more quickly; I kissed Hareton and took my leave; and since then he has become a stranger to me: and it is very strange, but I have no doubt that he has completely forgotten Ellen Dean, and that he has always been more precious to her, and she to him! At this point in her story, the housekeeper glanced at the clock above the mantelpiece and was surprised to see the minute hand pointing to half past one."
"She would not stay a moment longer: to tell the truth, I was rather inclined to postpone the continuation of her narrative. And now that she has vanished to her resting place, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go thither too, in spite of the painful torpor of my head and limbs. A charming introduction to the life of a hermit! Four weeks of torture, tossing and turning, and sickness! Oh, these biting winds, this biting northern sky, these impassable roads, and these slow country doctors! And oh, this absence of human faces! And, worst of all, Kenneth's dreadful intimation that I should not come out again until spring! Mr. Heathcliff has just graced me with his visit."
"About seven days ago, he sent me some grouse—the last of the season. What a scoundrel! He's not entirely innocent of my illness; and I was anxious to tell him so. But alas! How could I offend a man who was kind enough to sit by my bed for an hour and talk about something other than pills and medicines, blisters and leeches? It's a rather pleasant time."
"I'm too weak to read, but I think I could read something interesting. Why don't we let Mrs. Dean finish her story? I still remember the key events and how far she's come. Yes, I remember that her hero ran away and wasn't heard from for three years; and that the heroine got married."
"I'll call her; she'll be pleased to hear I'm having a good time. Mrs. Dean came in. ""It takes twenty minutes, sir, to take the medicine,"" she began. ""Take it off!"" I replied. ""I wish—"" ""The doctor says you must stop taking the powders."" ""With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and sit here."""
"Keep your hands off this bitter bottle phalanx. Take your knitting out of your pocket—it's enough—and pick up Mr. Heathcliff's story right where you left off, up to the present day. Did he finish his studies on the Continent and return a gentleman? Or did he secure a position as a sazar at the university, or did he escape to America and earn distinction there by spilling the blood of his host country? Or did he make his fortune more quickly on the English streets? ""He may have achieved something in all those professions, Mr. Lockwood; but I can vouch for none of them."""
"I have already said that I did not know how he came by his money; nor did I know the means by which he extricated himself from the barbarous ignorance into which he had fallen. But, with your permission, I will proceed in my own way, if you think it will amuse and not tire you. 'Are you better this morning?' 'Very well.' 'That is good news.' I drove Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my great disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I had dared to hope. She seemed almost too enthusiastic about Mr. Linton; and even towards her sister she showed much affection."
"Both were deeply concerned for each other's well-being. It wasn't the thorn that leaned toward the honeysuckle, but the honeysuckle that embraced it. Neither side made any concessions: one stood firm, the others gave in. And who can be choleric and quick-tempered when they encounter neither resistance nor indifference? I sensed that Mr. Edgar was very afraid of disturbing them."
"He concealed it from her; but whenever he heard me answer sharply, or saw another servant indignant at some peremptory order of his, he showed his displeasure by a frown that never darkened, even when directed at himself alone. Often he rebuked me severely for my insolence, declaring that a knife-thrust could not be more painful than the one he felt when he saw his lady so angry. In order not to anger a kind gentleman, I learned to be less irritable; and for six months the powder remained as harmless as sand, for there was no fire nearby to kindle it."
"Catherine sometimes experienced periods of depression and silence. Her husband respected them with approving silence, attributing them to a change in her constitution caused by her serious illness; she had never before been discouraged. He welcomed the return of the sun as an answer to her own. I think I can say that they truly felt a deep and growing happiness."
"It's over. Well, in the long run, you have to look after yourself; the meek and generous are, quite rightly, more selfish than the dominant; and it's over when circumstances make you feel that the other person's well-being isn't your primary concern. One quiet September evening, I came out of the garden carrying a heavy basket full of apples I'd picked."
"Dusk was falling, and the moon shone brightly on the high courtyard wall, casting indistinct shadows on the many overhangs of the building. I laid my burden on the steps by the kitchen door, rested a moment, and took one last deep breath of the sweet, sweet air. Gazing up at the moon, with my back to the door, I heard a voice behind me say, ""Nelly, is that you?"" It was a deep voice with a strange ring; yet something in the way I pronounced my name made it sound familiar. I turned anxiously to see who was speaking; for the doors were closed, and I had seen no one as I approached the steps."
"Something moved on the porch. As I approached, I saw a tall man, dressed in black, with a black face and black hair. He was leaning against the side, his fingers on the latch, as if he were about to open the door himself. ""Who could that be?"" I wondered. ""Mr. Earnshaw? Oh no! His voice doesn't sound like his own at all."" ""I've been waiting here for an hour,"" he continued, as I continued to stare. ""And the whole time, everything has been completely silent. I haven't dared go in."""
"Don't you know me? Look, I'm no stranger! A ray of sunlight illuminated his face; his cheeks were pale and half-covered with black sideburns; his eyebrows drooped, his eyes deep and strange. I remembered his eyes. ""What!"" I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and threw my hands in astonishment. ""What! Are you back? Really? Really?"" ""Yes, Heathcliff,"" he answered, looking alternately at me and the windows, in which twenty glittering moons were reflected, but no light shone. ""Are they home? Where is she? Nelly, you're not happy! Don't worry so much. Is she there? Speak! I want to speak to her, to your mistress."""
"""Go and tell them someone from Gimmerton wants to see her."" ""How will she react?"" I cried. ""What will she do? I'm completely astonished: she'll go mad! And you, you're Heathcliff! But different! No, this is inconceivable. Were you a soldier?"" ""Go and deliver my message,"" he interrupted impatiently. ""I'll be in hell until you do!"" He undid the latch, and I went in; but when I reached the parlor where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were sitting, I couldn't bring myself to go any further. Finally, I decided to ask them to light the candles, under the pretext of lighting them, and opened the door."
"They sat together at a window whose latticework leaned against the wall. Beyond the garden trees and the wild, green park lay the Gimmerton Valley, through which a long layer of mist wound its way almost to the top (for just beyond the chapel, as you may have noticed, the marsh brook joins a stream that follows the meandering glen). Above this silvery mist loomed Wuthering Heights; our old house, however, was invisible; it leaned toward the other side. The room, its inhabitants, and the landscape they beheld seemed strangely peaceful."
"I shrank from my errand; I was about to leave without saying anything, after asking my question about the candles, when, realizing my folly, I turned and whispered, ""Someone from Gimmerton wants to see you, madam."" ""What does he want?"" asked Mrs. Linton. ""I didn't ask him,"" I answered. ""Well, draw the curtains, Nelly,"" she said, ""and bring in the tea. I'll be back in a moment."" She left the apartment; Mr. Edgar casually asked who it was. ""Someone a mistress doesn't expect to see,"" I answered. ""That Heathcliff—you remember him, sir, who lived with Mr. Earnshaw."" ""What? The gypsy—the ploughman?"" he cried. ""Why didn't you tell Catherine?"" ""Hush! You mustn't call her that, madam,"" I said. ""She would be very sorry. She was almost sad when he ran away."""
"""I suppose his return will give him great joy."" Mr. Linton went to a window on the other side of the room, which looked out into the courtyard. He unlocked it and leaned out. I suppose they were downstairs, for he immediately called out, ""Don't stay, my dear! Show the person in if it's someone special."" Then I heard the latch click, and Catherine ran upstairs, breathless and beside herself, too excited to show her joy: from her expression, one might have expected some dreadful disaster. ""Oh, Edgar, Edgar!"" she gasped, flinging her arms around his neck. ""Oh, Edgar, my darling! Heathcliff is back, he's back!"" And she hugged him tighter. ""Now, now!"" cried her husband angrily, ""don't strangle me for this! He was never such a wonderful darling to me."""
"""Don't panic!"" ""I know you didn't like him,"" she replied, suppressing her joy a little. ""But for me, you have to be friends now. Should I ask him to come upstairs?"" ""Here,"" he said, ""in the living room?"" ""Where else?"" she asked. He seemed irritated and suggested the kitchen, a more suitable place."
"Mrs. Linton gave her a funny look, half angry, half laughing at her precision. ""No,"" she added after a moment, ""I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, who are of the nobility, and the other for Heathcliff and me, who are of the lower classes. Is that all right, my dear? Or should I have a fire lit elsewhere? If so, please give me instructions."""
"I'll hurry downstairs and escort my guest safely home. I'm afraid the joy is too great to be true! She was about to run away again, but Edgar held her back. ""Invite him in,"" he said, turning to me. ""And Catherine, try to be cheerful without appearing foolish. The whole household doesn't need to see you welcoming a runaway servant like a brother."" I went downstairs and found Heathcliff waiting on the veranda, obviously eager to come in."
"He followed my instructions without hesitation, and I led him to the gentleman and lady, whose rosy cheeks betrayed a cordial conversation. But the lady beamed in a different mood when her friend appeared on the threshold: She sprang forward, took his hands, and led him to Linton; then she grasped Linton's hesitant fingers and pressed them to hers. Now, as the fire and candlelight revealed them completely, I was more than ever amazed at Heathcliff's transformation."
"He had grown into a tall, athletic, and well-built man; next to him, my master appeared slim and youthful. His upright posture suggested he had served in the army. His expression and determination suggested a much older man than Mr. Linton; he seemed intelligent and showed no signs of past degradation."
"A semi-civilized savagery still lurked in his lowered brows and his eyes, which filled with black fire, but it was controlled; and his bearing was even dignified: free from any coarseness, though stern and graceful. My master's surprise was as great as, or even greater than, my own: for a moment he was at a loss as to how to address the ""ploughboy,"" as he had called him. Heathcliff lowered his slender hand and regarded him coolly until he finally decided to speak. ""Sit down, sir,"" he said finally. ""Mrs. Linton remembers the past and would like me to give you a warm welcome; and of course, I am glad when anything gives her pleasure."" ""And so am I,"" replied Heathcliff, ""especially if it is something that has happened to me."""
"""I'd be happy to stay an hour or two."" He sat opposite Catherine, who stared at him as if afraid he might disappear if she took him. He didn't often raise his eyes to her: a quick glance now and then was enough, but he reminded her with growing certainty of the undisguised joy he took in her. They were too absorbed in their shared joy to be embarrassed."
"Not so Mr. Edgar: he turned pale with anger, an emotion that reached its climax when His Ladyship rose, strode across the carpet, took Heathcliff's hands again, and burst into laughter. ""Tomorrow I shall think it was a dream!"" she cried. ""I shall not believe that I saw you again, touched you, and spoke to you. And yet, cruel Heathcliff! You do not deserve this reception. Three years of absence and silence, and no thought of me!"" ""A little more than you expected,"" he murmured. ""I heard of your wedding not so long ago, Cathy, and while I waited down in the courtyard, I was thinking of this plan: only to see your face again, perhaps a look of surprise and feigned amusement; and then to settle my score with Hindley; and finally, to escape justice by executing myself."""
"Your welcome has driven these thoughts from my mind; but beware, next time you meet me with a different attitude! No, you will not drive me away again. You really felt sorry for me, did you not? Well, there was reason to be. I have lived a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I have only fought for you! ""Catherine, if we will not have cold tea, come to table,"" interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his usual tone and due courtesy. ""Mr. Heathcliff will have a long way to go, wherever he is staying tonight; and I am thirsty."" She took her place before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having set up her chairs, I left the room."
"The meal lasted barely ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never refilled, so she couldn't eat or drink. Edgar had made a small hole in his saucer and could barely take a bite."
"Their guest stayed no more than an hour that evening. As we left, I asked him if he had been to Gimmerton. ""No, to Wuthering Heights,"" he replied. ""Mr. Earnshaw invited me when I called this morning."" Mr. Earnshaw invited him! And he invited Mr. Earnshaw! I had to think about that sentence after he left. Had he become a hypocrite, coming to the country to make trouble under false pretenses? I asked myself: deep down, I felt he would have been better off staying away."
"Around midnight, Mrs. Linton woke me from my first nap. She crept into my room, sat on my bed, and pulled me awake by my hair. ""I can't sleep, Ellen,"" she said apologetically. ""And I need a living being to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is grumpy because I'm happy about something that doesn't interest him: he refuses to open his mouth except for surly, senseless chatter; and he acted as if I were cruel and selfish for wanting to talk while he was so sick and tired. He's always sick at the slightest thing! I complimented Heathcliff, and he began to cry, either from a headache or from jealousy. So I got up and left him alone."" ""What's the use of congratulating Heathcliff?"" I replied. ""As children, they hated each other, and Heathcliff would have been just as disgusted to hear them praised: it's human nature. Leave Mr. Linton alone unless you want an open quarrel between them."" ""But isn't that a sign of great weakness?"" she continued. ""I am not jealous: the luster of Isabella's fair hair and white skin, her graceful elegance, and the affection the whole family shows her, never hurt me."""
"Even you, Nelly, when we quarrel, Isabella is happy to support you; and I confess that, like a foolish mother, I call her 'darling' and flatter her humorously. Her brother is pleased that we get along well, and that pleases me. But they are very alike: they are spoiled children and think the world was made for them; and although I am kind to both of them, I believe a good chastisement might reform them. 'You are mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' I said. 'They are kind to you; I know what would happen if they were not.'"
"You can certainly afford to indulge their whims, as long as it is their duty to attend to your every wish. However, it may happen that you quarrel over a matter of equal importance to both sides; and then those who call you weak may well be as stubborn as you. ""And then we shall fight to the death, shall we not, Nelly?"" she answered, laughing. ""No! I tell you, I have such confidence in Linton's love that I believe I could kill him and he would not take revenge."" I advised her to appreciate him all the more for his affection. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""but he needn't be ashamed of trifles."" That is childish, and instead of bursting into tears because I told him that Heathcliff now deserved everyone's esteem and it would be an honor for the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he should have said it for me and been filled with compassion."
"He must get used to him, and he likes him only too well. Considering that Heathcliff has reason to oppose him, I am sure he has behaved admirably! ""What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?"" I asked. ""He is evidently reformed in every way: a true Christian. He turns to his enemies everywhere!"" ""He has explained it,"" she replied. ""I am as surprised as you are. He said he came to your house to inquire about me, supposing you still lived there. And Joseph told this to Hindley, who came out and questioned him about what he had been doing and how he lived. And finally, he invited him in. There were some people there playing cards. Heathcliff joined them. My brother lost money with him, and when he saw that he was well provided for, he invited him to come back in the evening, which he accepted."
"Hindley is too hasty to choose his acquaintances carefully: he does not take the trouble to consider the reasons that might lead him to distrust one whom he has grievously offended. Yet Heathcliff says the chief reason for renewing his acquaintance with his old persecutor is the desire to settle in lodgings within a few steps of the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; also the hope of seeing him more often than if he were residing at Gimmerton. He intends to offer generous compensation for permission to remain at the Heights; and my brother's avarice will doubtless induce him to accept the conditions: he has always been avaricious; even when he seizes with one hand, he throws away with the other. ""It is a fine place for a young man!"" I said. ""Aren't you afraid of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?"" ""Not for my friend,"" she replied. ""His strong mind will protect him from danger. A little for Hindley. But he can't become morally worse than he is. And I stand between him and physical harm."""
"Today's event has reconciled me with God and humanity! I had rebelled against Providence. Oh, I have endured very, very bitter suffering, Nelly! If this creature knew how bitter she is, she would be ashamed to mar her salvation with unnecessary ill-humor. Out of kindness to him, I endured it alone: Had I expressed my often-felt pain, he would have longed for relief as much as I did."
"But it's over, and I won't take revenge for her folly; I can afford anything in the future! If the meanest creature in the world slapped me on the cheek, I would not only turn to the other, but also beg her forgiveness for the provocation; and as proof, I would immediately reconcile myself with Edgar. ""Good night! I am an angel!"" With this satisfied conviction, she left, and the success of her plan was evident the next day: Mr. Linton had not only lost his bad temper (though his temper still seemed tempered by Catherine's exuberant vivacity), but he dared not contradict her when she took Isabel to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with a summer so sweet and loving that the house was a paradise for days; master and servant enjoyed the eternal sunshine. Heathcliff—and from now on I shall call him Mr. Heathcliff—at first exercised his freedom to visit Thrushcross Grange cautiously, apparently wanting to gauge the extent to which the lord would tolerate his interference."
"Catherine, too, considered it advisable to temper her joy at his reception; and gradually he earned the right to be expected. He retained much of the reserve so characteristic of his youth, which helped to suppress unexpected outbursts of emotion. My master's anxiety subsided, and other circumstances temporarily dispelled it."
"His renewed anger arose from the unexpected misfortune of Isabella Linton, who suddenly and irresistibly felt attracted to the tolerated guest. She was then a charming young woman of eighteen, childlike in manners, but with a lively mind, strong feelings, and a lively, albeit irritating, temperament. Her brother, who loved her dearly, was astonished at this fantastic predilection."
"Apart from the humiliation that came with a union with an unknown man, and the possibility that his fortune, in the absence of a male heir, might pass into the hands of such a man, he possessed the common sense to understand Heathcliff's nature: he knew that, despite his altered appearance, his spirit had remained unaltered and unchanged. And he feared that spirit, he hated it; he recoiled at the thought of entrusting Isabella to him. He would have recoiled even more had he known that his affection was spontaneous and given without reciprocation; for as soon as he learned of her existence, he had blamed Heathcliff for his well-conceived plan."
"We had all noticed for some time that Miss Linton was gloomy and serious. She was becoming irritable and annoying; she constantly annoyed Catherine and strained her patience, testing her patience to the limit. We partly excused her on the grounds of her poor health: her condition was visibly worsening."
"But one day, when she was behaving strangely obstinately, refusing breakfast and complaining that the servants disobeyed her; that the housekeeper wouldn't let her in and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold because the doors had been left open and we had deliberately left out the parlor fire to annoy her, among a hundred other absurd accusations, Mrs. Linton insisted that she go to bed and, after scolding her, threatened to call the doctor. The mention of Kenneth made her immediately exclaim that he was perfectly healthy and that it was only Catherine's hardness of heart that made her unhappy. ""How can you say I'm hard, you little flattering rascal?"" cried the housekeeper, astonished at this unreasonable assertion. ""You're losing your mind. When did I lose it, tell me?"" ""Yesterday,"" sobbed Isabella, ""and now!"" ""Yesterday!"" said her sister-in-law. ""On what occasion?"" ""During our walk on the moor, you suggested I could lounge about as I pleased while you lounged about with Mr. Heathcliff?"" ""And that was your idea of harshness?"" said Catherine, laughing. ""Didn't that mean your company was unnecessary? We didn't care whether you stayed with us or not; I only thought Heathcliff's conversation wouldn't distract you."" ""Oh no,"" sobbed the young woman; ""you wished I were gone because you knew I liked being there!"" ""Is she of her mind?"" asked Mrs. Linton pleadingly. ""I will repeat our conversation word for word, Isabella; and you can tell me what charm it had for you."" ""I don't mind the conversation,"" she replied. ""I wish—"" ""Well?"" "" asked Catherine, hesitating to finish her sentence. ""With him: and I'm not always sent away!"" she continued angrily. ""You're a dog in a manger, Cathy, and you only want to be loved by yourself!"" ""You're a cheeky little monkey!"" cried Mrs. Linton in astonishment. ""But I don't believe this nonsense! It's impossible that you covet Heathcliff's admiration, that you find him sympathetic! I hope I misunderstood you, Isabella?"" ""No, not at all,"" said the girl, madly in love. ""I love him more than you ever loved Edgar, and he could love me if you let him!"" ""Then I wouldn't be you for the world!"" declared Catherine gravely, seeming to mean it. ""Nelly, help me convince her of her folly."""
"Tell him what Heathcliff is: a pristine creature, uncultivated, uncultured; a desolate desert of gorse and basalt. I would sooner set that little canary in the park one winter's day than advise you to give him your heart! It is your lamentable ignorance of his character, my child, and nothing else that makes you dream. Do not think that he conceals deep kindness and affection beneath a stern facade! He is no diamond in the rough, no pearl-digger: he is a wild, pitiless man, a wolf."
"I never say to him, ""Leave this or that enemy alone, for it would be cruel and mean to hurt him."" I say, ""Leave them alone, for I would not have them wronged."" And he would crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if you were a burden to him. I know he could not love a Linton; and yet he would most likely marry your fortune and your hopes: avarice grows in him like a stubborn sin. It is my image: and I am his friend, so much so that, if he had seriously thought of capturing you, I might have kept silent and let you fall into his trap. Miss Linton stared at her sister-in-law indignantly. ""Shame! Shame!"" she repeated angrily. ""You are worse than twenty enemies, you poisonous friend!"" ""Ah! You don't believe me?"" said Catherine. ""Do you think I speak from malicious selfishness?"" ""I know,"" Isabella replied, ""and I shudder for you!"" ""Bravo!"" cried the other. ""Try it yourself, if you will: I have done it, and I abandon the argument of your audacity."" ""And I must pay for her selfishness!"" she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room. ""Everything, everything is against me: she has spoiled my only consolation."""
"But she lied, didn't she? Mr. Heathcliff is no devil: he has an honorable and upright soul, or he would remember her. ""Put him out of your thoughts, miss,"" I said. ""He is a sinister bird: no partner for you."" Mrs. Linton spoke sharply, and yet I cannot contradict her. She knows his heart better than I or anyone else; and she would never present him in a worse light."
"Honest people don't hide their deeds. How did he live? How did he become rich? Why does he live in Wuthering Heights, the house of a man he despises? It's said that Mr. Earnshaw's health has deteriorated since his arrival. They stay up all night together, and Hindley borrows money on his land and does nothing but gamble and drink. I only found out a week ago—Joseph told me—that I met him in Gimmerton. ""Nelly,"" he said, ""you've got plenty of time to visit the Crown Jewelers, folks."""
"One almost has his finger chopped off, while the other stabs his flipper like a calf. He's the master, yes, that's right, who goes so far as to attack the greats. He's not afraid of the judges, not Paul, not Peter, not John, not Matthew, not them, is he? He loves it—he wants his cheeky face to look like theirs! And that nice boy, Heathcliff, mind you, he's rare."
"He laughs as well as anyone at a joke about a real devil. Doesn't he tell us of his good life among us when he goes to the manor? Here's how it is: rising at sunset: dice, brandy, closed shutters, and candles until noon the next day: then the gangs betray and curse his comrade, which shames honest people; what can this farmer do, what can he earn for himself, if he doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, and goes to the neighbor's to gossip with his wife? Of course, he tells Lady Catherine how his father's gold disappears into his pocket, and how his father's son gallops down the high road while he himself runs to open the pikes! Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rogue, but no liar; and if his story of Heathcliff's behavior is true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you? ""You're in cahoots with the others, Ellen!"" she answered. “I will not listen to your slander.”"
"How wicked you must be to attempt to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!’ I cannot say whether she would have been able to overcome this madness, had she been left to herself, or whether she would have persisted in it: she had little time for reflection. The next day there was a session of law in the neighboring town; my master was to be present, and Mr. Heathcliff, conscious of his absence, arrived a little earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were in the library, in a hostile mood, but silent: the latter was disturbed by her recent indiscretion, and the exposure of her secret feelings in a brief fit of rage; the former, on mature reflection, was sincerely offended by her companion; and if she again laughed at her insolence, she was disposed to forbid her from laughing."
"She laughed when she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the fireplace and saw a mischievous smile on his lips. Isabella, lost in thought or a book, stayed until the door opened; it was too late for an escape attempt, which she would have gladly made if it had been possible. ""Come in, it doesn't matter!"" cried the hostess cheerfully, pulling a chair up to the fire. ""Here are two people who desperately need a third person to melt the ice between them; and you are the one we should choose."""
"Heathcliff, I'm proud to finally show you someone who loves you more than I do. I hope you're flattered. No, it's not Nelly; don't look at her! My poor sister-in-law's heart breaks at the mere sight of your physical and moral beauty."
"""You have the power to be Edgar's brother! No, no, Isabella, you must not run away,"" she continued, mocking the bewildered girl who had risen indignantly and with feigned gaiety. ""We have fought over you, Heathcliff, like cats; I have been defeated in my protestations of devotion and admiration. Moreover, I am told that if I had only the courtesy to withdraw, my rival would, at her pleasure, shoot an arrow through your soul that would bind you forever and consign my image to eternal oblivion!"" ""Catherine!"" said Isabella, filled with dignity and refusing to free herself from the grip that held her, ""I would be grateful if you would stick to the truth and not slander me, even in jest!"" ""Mr. Heathcliff, be so kind as to ask your friend to release me. She forgets that we are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her pains me indescribably."" Since the guest made no reply, but sat down and seemed completely indifferent to her feelings for him, she turned and murmured a sincere plea for freedom to her tormentor. ""No way!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""I will no longer be called a dog in a manger. You MUST stay: immediately! Heathcliff, why don't you show yourself satisfied with my good news? Isabella swears that Edgar's love for me is nothing compared to her love for you. I'm sure she's made a speech like this before, hasn't she, Ellen? And she's been fasting since the walk the day before yesterday, out of grief and anger that I kept her from you because I deemed her unacceptable."" ""I think you're lying to her,"" said Heathcliff, turning his chair toward them. ""In any case, she's now leaving my company!"" And he stared intently at the subject of conversation, as one might stare at a strange and repulsive creature: an Indian centipede, for example, which one studies out of curiosity despite the dislike it arouses."
"The poor creature could not bear this; she quickly turned white and red, and with tears in her eyelashes stretched out her little fingers to free Catherine's grip. No sooner had she released one finger from her arm than another closed, impossible to withdraw entirely. Then she began to use her claws; their sharpness soon adorned those of the prisoner with crescent-shaped talons. ""There's a tigress!"" cried Mrs. Linton, releasing her and squeezing her hand painfully. ""Go away, for goodness' sake, and hide your pretty face! What madness to show him those claws! Can't you imagine what conclusions he will draw? Look, Heathcliff! They are instruments of execution; watch your eyes."" ""I would tear them from her fingers if they threatened me,"" he replied harshly, as the door closed behind her. ""But what did you mean by teasing that animal like that, Cathy? You weren't telling the truth, were you?"" ""I assured you,"" she replied. ""She's been pining over you for weeks, and this morning she went completely berserk, hurling insults at you because I pointed out your faults so clearly, in an attempt to dampen her admiration. But don't you see: I wanted to punish her insolence, that's all."""
"I love her too much, my dear Heathcliff, to allow you to possess her and devour her whole. 'And I love her too much to try,' he said, 'except in a very uncanny way. You would hear strange things if I lived alone with that sentimental, waxen face. The most common thing would be to paint it every day or two in the colors of the rainbow, and blacken the blue eyes. They make Linton's eyes look terrible.' 'Beautiful!' remarked Catherine. 'They are dove-like eyes, angel-like eyes!' 'She is her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a pause. 'I should be sorry,' replied his companion. ""Half a dozen nephews would extinguish her title, God willing! Now let your thoughts wander: you are too much inclined to covet your neighbor's goods. Remember, that neighbor's goods are mine."" ""If they were mine, they would be no less mine,"" said Heathcliff. ""But Isabella Linton may be an idiot, but she is certainly not mad. In short, we let the matter rest, as you advise me."" From their words, they let the matter rest; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts, too. The other, I felt sure, remembered this often during the evening."
"I saw him smiling inwardly—or rather, grimacing—and sinking into disturbing reveries whenever Mrs. Linton was out of the room. I resolved to observe his every move. My heart was always decidedly on the side of the gentleman and not Catherine's: rightly so, I supposed, for he was kind, trusting, and honorable; and she—one could hardly say she was the opposite, yet she seemed to allow herself such license that I had little confidence in her principles and even less understanding of her feelings."
"I wished something would happen that would free Wuthering Heights and the barn from Mr. Heathcliff and leave us as we were before his arrival. His visits were a constant nightmare for me; and, I suspected, for my master as well. His stay at Wuthering Heights was an incredible burden."
"I felt as if God had left the stray sheep to wander on its own, and that a wild beast was lurking among the sheep and the flock, just waiting for the moment to attack and destroy them. Sometimes, when I was alone thinking about these things, I would suddenly jump up in fear, put on my hat, and go and see what was going on at the farm. I would convince myself it was my duty to warn him about people's comments about his behavior; then I would remember his persistent bad habits, and, hoping to help him, I would not enter that dreary house, doubting that I could bear to be taken at his word."
"One day, while making a detour to Gimmerton, I passed the old gate. This is roughly where my story unfolded: a clear, icy afternoon; the ground was bare and the road hard and dry. I came to a rock where the road turns left toward the moor; a rough pillar of sand bearing the letter W."
"H. to the north, G. to the east, and T. G. to the southwest. It serves as a guide to the Grange, the Heights, and the village."
"The sun cast a yellowish tinge on its gray head and reminded me of summer. I can't say why, but suddenly a wave of childhood washed over me. Hindley and I had made it our favorite spot twenty years ago. I stared at the weathered block for a long time; then I bent down and saw a hole at the bottom, still full of snail shells and pebbles, which we liked to store there with other perishable foods. And as fresh as reality, it seemed to me as if I were seeing my old playmate again sitting on the parched lawn: his dark, angular head bent forward, his small hand poking a piece of slate in the earth. ""Poor Hindley!"" I cried involuntarily."
"I shuddered: my physical eye was deceived for a moment, for I thought the child had raised its face and was staring straight into my eyes! It had disappeared in an instant; but I immediately felt an irresistible desire to reach the hill. Superstition urged me to yield to this impulse: Let's imagine he's dead! I thought—or he would die soon!—Let's imagine this is a sign of death! The closer I got to the house, the more agitated I became; and at the sight of him, I trembled all over. The apparition had caught up with me: he was looking through the gate."
"That was my first thought when I saw a boy with brown, elfin eyes pressing his rosy face against the bars. After much consideration, I realized it must be Hareton, MY Hareton, who had changed little since I had left him ten months earlier. ""God bless you, my darling!"" I cried, instantly forgetting my foolish fears. ""Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, your nurse."" He stepped back and picked up a large flint. ""I've come to see your father, Hareton,"" I added, concluding from the gesture that Nelly, if she still lived in his memory, was not one with me. He raised his missile to throw it; I began a soothing speech, but could not stop his hand: the flint struck my hat; then a series of curses escaped the stammering man, which, whether he understood them or not, were uttered with controlled emphasis and distorted his childlike face into an expression of surprise and malice."
"Don't worry, that made me more sad than angry. I could barely cry, so I took an orange out of my pocket and offered it to him to calm him down. He hesitated for a moment, then snatched it from my hand, as if he thought I was just trying to seduce and disappoint him."
"I held up another and held it out of his reach. ""Who taught you those fine words, my dear?"" I asked. ""The priest?"" ""Goodness me, the priest and you! Give me this,"" he replied. ""Tell us where you learned your lessons, and you'll understand,"" I said. ""Who is your teacher?"" ""Wicked Papa,"" he replied. ""And what do you learn from Papa?"" I continued. He pounced on the fruit; I lifted it higher. ""What does he teach you?"" I asked. ""Nothing,"" he said, ""except to stay out of his way. Papa can't stand me because I scold him."" ""Ah! And the devil teaches you to scold Papa?"" I remarked. ""Yes... no,"" he drawled. ""Who then?"" ""Heathcliff."" ""I asked him if he liked Mr. Heathcliff."" ""Yes!"" he replied."
"To understand why he loved her, I could only formulate the following sentences: ""I know: he gives back to Papa what he gives me; he curses Papa because he curses me. He tells me to do what I want."" ""And the priest doesn't teach you to read and write?"" I continued. ""No, I'm told the priest will have his teeth cut if he crosses the threshold promised by Heathcliff!"" I pressed the orange into his hand and told him to tell his father that a woman named Nelly Dean was waiting for him at the garden gate to speak to him. He went up the path and into the house; but instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the doorstep; I turned immediately and ran down the road as fast as I could. Only at the signpost did I stop, as frightened as if I had raised a gnome."
"This had little to do with Miss Isabella's affair, but it prompted me to remain vigilant and do everything I could to prevent the spread of such an evil influence at the Grange, even if it meant causing a domestic uproar by interrupting Mrs. Linton's festivities. The next time Heathcliff came by, my young wife was feeding pigeons in the yard. She hadn't spoken to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had also stopped complaining, which was a great consolation."
"I knew Heathcliff wasn't overly polite to Miss Linton. As soon as he saw her, the first thing he did was thoroughly inspect the front door. I stood at the kitchen window, but withdrew so as not to be seen."
"Then he crossed the sidewalk and said something. She seemed shy and about to leave. To stop her, he put his hand on her arm. She turned her face away. Obviously, he was asking her a question she didn't want to answer. Another quick glance toward the house followed, and, thinking he wouldn't be seen, the villain had the audacity to embrace her. ""Judas! Traitor!"" I exclaimed. ""Aren't you also a hypocrite? A deliberate imposter."" ""Who's there, Nelly?"" Catherine's voice asked beside me. I was too engrossed in the couple outside to notice their entrance. ""Your good-for-nothing friend!"" I replied warmly. ""That skulking villain over there."""
"Ah, he's seen us, he's coming in! I wonder if he'll have the heart to find a plausible excuse for sleeping with Miss, when he said he hated her."" Mrs. Linton suddenly saw Isabella running into the garden; a minute later, Heathcliff opened the door. I could not suppress my indignation; but Catherine furiously demanded silence and threatened to send me out of the kitchen if I dared to reveal my insolence. ""If they hear you, you might be taken for the mistress!"" she cried. ""Take your place! Heathcliff, what are you going to do, making such a fuss? I told you to leave Isabella alone! Pray, unless you are tired of being received here and want Linton to shoot you in the face!"" ""God forbid!"" answered the black villain. I hated him at that moment. ""My God, keep him gentle and patient! I've been getting angrier ever since I sent him to heaven!"" ""Shh!"" said Catherine, closing the inner door! ""Don't make me angry."""
"Why did you ignore my request? Did she deliberately pressure you? ""What's it to you?"" he growled. ""I have the right to kiss her if she wishes, and you have no right to oppose it. I am not your husband: you have no right to be jealous of me!"" ""I am not jealous of you,"" replied the mistress. ""I am jealous of you. Wash your face: you have no right to look at me angrily! If you love Isabella, you must marry her."""
"But do you love him? Tell the truth, Heathcliff! You won't answer, will you? I'm sure of it. ""And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying this man?"" I asked. ""Mr. Linton would approve,"" Madame replied firmly. ""Spare him the trouble,"" said Heathcliff. ""I could just as well do without his consent. And as for you, Catherine, while we're at it, I have a few words to say."""
"I want you to know that I know you have treated me like hell—like hell! Do you hear me? And if you imagine I don't notice it, you are a fool; and if you think I will be consoled with gentle words, you are an idiot; and if you think I will suffer without avenging myself, I shall soon convince you of the contrary! In the meantime, thank you for letting me in on your sister-in-law's secret: I swear I will make the best of it. And leave you alone! ""What a new turn in her character!"" cried Mrs. Linton in astonishment. ""I have treated you like hell, and you are avenging yourself! How can you do it, you ungrateful animal? How have I treated you like hell?"" ""I don't mean to be avenged upon you,"" replied Heathcliff less violently. ""That is not my intention."" The tyrant oppresses his slaves, and they do not turn against him; they oppress those under their command."
"You can torture me to death for your own amusement, but let me have a little fun just the same, and refrain from insulting you if possible. Now that I've destroyed my palace, don't build yourself a hut and smugly boast of your charity in giving me one. If I imagined you really wanted me to marry Isabel, I'd slit my throat! ""Oh, the worst of it is: I'm not jealous, am I?"" cried Catherine. ""Well, I won't repeat my marriage proposal: that's as bad as offering a lost soul to Satan."""
"Your happiness, like his, lies in sowing misfortune. You prove it. Edgar has recovered from the anger he felt at your arrival; I am beginning to feel safe and peaceful; and you, who do not want us to live in peace, seem determined to quarrel."
"Quarrel with Edgar, I beg you, Heathcliff, and betray his sister. You will find the most effective way to repay me. The conversation broke off. Mrs. Linton sat red and sullen by the fire. The spirit that served her was out of control: she could neither restrain nor control it."
"He stood with folded arms before the fire, brooding over his gloomy thoughts. In this attitude I left them to seek the gentleman, who was wondering what had detained Catherine so long below. ""Ellen,"" he said, as I entered, ""have you seen your mistress?"" ""Yes, she is in the kitchen, sir,"" I answered. ""She is very much annoyed with Mr. Heathcliff's conduct, and I think it is time she changed her ways. It is dangerous to be too indulgent, and now it has come to this—"" And I described the scene in court, and, as best I dared, the whole quarrel that ensued. I supposed it would not do Mrs. Linton much harm; unless she did so herself later by taking up the defense of her guest."
"Edgar Linton could hardly listen to me. His first words betrayed that he had not absolved his wife of all responsibility. ""It is intolerable!"" he cried. ""It is a scandal that she considers him a friend and forces his company on me! Call two men from the hall, Ellen. Catherine will not quarrel with that scoundrel any more—I have had enough of her."" He went downstairs, ordered the servants to wait in the hall, and, followed by me, went into the kitchen."
"The inhabitants of the house had resumed their heated argument: Mrs. Linton, at least, was cursing with renewed vigor; Heathcliff had gone to the window and hung his head, evidently somewhat intimidated by her harsh criticism. He first noticed the master of the house and made a sign to her to be quiet; she obeyed abruptly when she learned the reason for his insinuations. ""How?"" Linton asked her. ""What decency have you to stay here, after the language this villain uses with you? I suppose you pay no attention to him, for it is his usual language: you are accustomed to his baseness, and perhaps you think I could get used to it too!"" ""Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?"" asked the mistress of the house, in a tone intended to provoke her husband, and which expressed both indifference and contempt for his anger. Heathcliff, who had opened his eyes at the first words, laughed mockingly at the last, apparently deliberately to attract Mr. Linton's attention."
"He succeeded, but Edgar had no intention of entertaining him with unbridled passion. ""I have been patient with you so far, sir,"" he said calmly. ""Not that I am unaware of your wretched and depraved character, but I felt you were only partly responsible. And since Catherine wished to maintain contact with you, I—foolishly—agreed. Your presence is a moral poison that would infect even the most virtuous. For this reason, and to avoid worse, I deny you immediate access to this house and hereby notify you that I demand your immediate departure. Three minutes' delay makes this departure involuntary and shameful."""
"Heathcliff regarded the speaker with a mocking expression. ""Cathy, your little lamb is as dangerous as a bull!"" he said. ""He's threatening to split his head on my fingers. My goodness! Mr. Linton, I'm terribly sorry you're not worth shooting!"" My master looked down the corridor and signaled to me to fetch the men; he didn't want to risk a personal confrontation. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed me; and as I was about to call her, she pulled me back, slammed the door, and locked it. ""Good intentions!"" she said, in response to her husband's angry and surprised look. ""If you don't have the courage to attack him, excuse yourself, or you'll get a beating."""
"Thus, you appear no braver than you are. No, I will swallow the key before you receive it! I am richly rewarded for my kindness to all! After constantly yielding to the weakness of one and the malice of another, I deserve in return two examples of blind ingratitude, stupid to the point of absurdity! Edgar, I have defended you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff would whip you to death for daring to entertain an evil thought against me! He needed no whip to produce this effect on the master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's hand, and as a precaution, she threw it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar trembled nervously, and his face turned deathly pale."
"He couldn't shake the feelings: a mixture of fear and humiliation completely overwhelmed him. He leaned back in a chair and covered his face. ""Oh dear! You should have been knighted for this once!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""We're beaten! We're beaten! Heathcliff would attack you as soon as the king would send his army against a colony of mice. Chin up! You'll be fine! You're not a lamb, but a young suckling bunny."" ""I wish you luck with that puny, milk-blooded creature, Cathy!"" said her friend. ""I congratulate you on your taste."""
"And that's the slobbering, trembling thing you preferred to me! I wouldn't strike him with my fist, but I would kick him and give him great satisfaction. ""Is he crying or fainting with fear?"" The fellow came forward and pushed aside the chair Linton was sitting on. He should have kept his distance: My master jumped up quickly and struck him right in the throat—a blow that would have brought down a lighter man."
"He was briefly out of breath; and while he was gasping for breath, Mr. Linton went through the back door into the garden and from there to the front entrance. ""Why? You weren't here at all!"" cried Catherine. ""Go away now! He's coming back with a pair of pistols and half a dozen servants. If he heard us, he'll never forgive you, of course. You've wronged me, Heathcliff! But go, hurry! I'd rather see Edgar from afar than you."" ""Do you think I'll go away with this burning blow in my throat?"" he thundered. ""For heaven's sake, no! I'll crush his ribs like a rotten nut before I cross the threshold! If I don't lay him down now, I'll kill him one day; so, since you value his existence, let me get him!"" ""He won't come,"" I interrupted, inventing a lie. ""Here are the coachman and the two gardeners; you will certainly not be eager to be forced into the street by them! Each has a cudgel; and the master will no doubt be watching from the parlor window to see whether they obey his orders."" The gardeners and the coachman were there, but Linton was among them."
"They had already entered the courtyard. After careful consideration, Heathcliff decided to avoid a fight with three subordinates: He grabbed the poker, broke the lock on the inner door, and fled as they stumbled inside. Mrs. Linton, very agitated, asked me to accompany her upstairs."
"She didn't know I had contributed to the uproar, and I was determined to keep her guessing. ""I'm almost mad, Nelly!"" she cried, throwing herself onto the sofa. ""A thousand hammer blows are hitting me on the head! Tell Isabella to stay away from me; this noise is her fault; and if she or anyone else increases my anger now, I'll be furious. And, Nelly, tell Edgar, when you see him again tonight, that I'm likely to become seriously ill. I hope it's true."""
"He has given me a good fright and upset me! I want to frighten him. Besides, he could easily launch into a series of insults and complaints; I'm sure I'd have to accuse him, and God knows where that would end! Will you do that, my dear Nelly? You know I am absolutely innocent in this matter. What made him listen to me? Heathcliff's speech caused a scandal after your departure; but I could have quickly gotten him away from Isabella, and the rest would have been meaningless."
"Now everything collapses; through the madness of hearing one's own wickedness, which haunts some like a demon! If Edgar had never heard our conversation, he would have been no worse off. Frankly, when he cried out in that tone of unreasoning displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff so fiercely that my voice grew hoarse, I didn't care what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene ended, we would all be torn apart for who knows how long! Well, if I can't keep Heathcliff as a friend—if Edgar is wicked and jealous—I'll try to break their hearts by breaking mine. That would be a quick way to end everything when I'm at my limit! But that's the sort of thing to reserve for desperate hopes; I wouldn't surprise Linton with it."
"So far, he has been reserved in his fear of provoking me; you must make him understand the danger of deviating from this policy and remind him of my passionate temper, which, when aflame, borders on fury. I wish you could banish this apathy from this face and regard me with a little more sympathy. The stoic attitude with which I received these instructions was undoubtedly frustrating enough: for they were given in all sincerity; but I believed that one who can anticipate her changes of mood can, even under her influence, maintain a certain degree of self-control through willpower; and I did not want to ""frighten"" her husband, as she put it, or aggravate his problems for the benefit of his selfishness. Therefore, when I met the gentleman in the parlor, I said nothing; but I allowed myself to return to listen in case their quarrel flared up again."
"He spoke first. ""Stay where you are, Catherine,"" he said, not angrily, but with a touch of despair and sadness. ""I will not stay. I have not come to quarrel or to reconcile; I only wish to know if, after the events of this evening, you wish to continue your intimacy with…"" ""Oh, for goodness' sake,"" interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, ""for goodness' sake, let's speak of it no more! Your coolness cannot be turned into fever: your veins are full of icy water; but mine boil, and the sight of that cold makes them dance."" ""To get rid of me, answer my question,"" insisted Mr. Linton. ""You must answer it; and I do not mind this violence. I have found that you can be as stoic as anyone when you want to be."""
"Will you deny Heathcliff after all this, or will you deny me? It is impossible for you to be both MY friend and HIS; and I absolutely DEMAND to know for whom you choose. ""I demand to be left alone!"" cried Catherine angrily. ""I demand it! Can't you see I can hardly stand? Edgar, you—you're leaving me!"" She rang the bell until it broke with a sharp noise; I entered slowly. Such senseless, vicious outbursts of rage were a test of a saint's character! She lay beating her head against the back of the sofa, grinding her teeth as if they would break at any moment! Mr. Linton looked at her suddenly with an expression of regret and fear. He told me to fetch some water."
"She couldn't breathe or speak. I brought her a full glass, and when she refused to drink, I splashed the water in her face. After a few seconds, she stretched stiffly and opened her eyes. Her cheeks, pale and deathly pale, looked dead."
"Linton looked scared. ""It's okay,"" I whispered. I didn't want him to give up, even though deep down I was scared. ""She has blood on her lips!"" he said, shuddering. ""Leave her alone!"" I snapped. And I told him how, before he arrived, she had decided to vent her anger in a fit of rage."
"I told the story aloud and casually, and she heard me; for she flinched: her hair blew over her shoulders, her eyes flashed, the muscles of her neck and arms tensed unusually. I thought she had at least broken some bones; but she looked around briefly and then hurried from the room. The Lord commanded me to follow her, which I did, to the door of her room; she prevented me from going any further by locking it against me."
"Since she didn't offer to prepare breakfast the next morning, I asked her if she wanted something delivered. ""No!"" she answered firmly. The same question was repeated at dinner and snack time, and the next day, and the answer was the same. Mr. Linton spent his time in the library and didn't inquire about his wife's activities."
"He and Isabella conversed for an hour, during which he endeavored to inspire in her a just disgust at Heathcliff's advances; but understanding nothing of her evasive answers, he was compelled to end the interrogation unsatisfactorily; he added, however, a solemn warning: that if she were foolish enough to encourage this unworthy suitor, it would destroy all connection between her and him. While Miss Linton walked about the park and garden, always silent and almost always in tears; while her brother hid behind books which he never opened—weary, I supposed, with the constant and vague expectation that Catherine, repentant of her conduct, would come of her own accord to beg pardon and seek a reconciliation—and while she obstinately fasted, probably supposing that Edgar was suffocated by his absence at every meal, and only his pride prevented him from throwing himself at his feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange housed only one rational soul, and that this soul dwelt in my body. I did not fail to sympathize with Mademoiselle and reprimand my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who longed to hear his wife's name for fear of hearing her voice."
"I decided to proceed as I thought best. And although it was an agonizingly slow process, I finally got a vague idea of its progress: just as I had first suspected. On the third day, Mrs. Linton opened her door, drank water from her pitcher and can, and asked for more and a bowl of porridge, for she thought she was dying. I wrote this down as an address to Edgar; I didn't believe it, so I kept it to myself and brought him tea and dry toast."
"She ate and drank greedily and sank back on her pillow with a groan, clenching her hands and fists. ""Oh, I shall die,"" she cried, ""for no one cares about me. I wish I hadn't."" Then, a long time later, I heard her murmur, ""No, I shall not die—he would be pleased—he doesn't love me at all—he would never miss me!"" ""Would you like something, madam?"" I asked, maintaining my apparent composure despite her hideous expression and strange, exaggerated behavior. ""What is this listless creature doing?"" she asked, pushing the thick, matted curls from her gaunt face. ""Has he become lethargic, or is he dead?"" ""Neither,"" I replied; ""if you mean Mr. Linton."" He's doing quite well, I think, although his studies keep him more occupied than necessary: he's constantly engrossed in his books because he has no company. I wouldn't have spoken like that if I'd known her true condition, but I couldn't shake the thought that she had a hand in his moodiness. ""In his books!"" she cried in astonishment. ""And I'm dying! I'm on the verge of the grave! Good heavens! Does he know how much I've changed?"" she continued, staring at her reflection on the opposite wall. ""Is it Catherine Linton? He imagines me as a pet—perhaps a playmate."""
"Can't you tell him it's terribly serious? Nelly, if it's not too late, as soon as I know how he is, I'll choose between two options: either starve to death immediately—it would be no punishment if he had no heart—or get well and leave the country. Are you telling the truth about him? Be careful. Is he really so indifferent to my life? ""Well, madam,"" I answered, ""the master doesn't know you're mad; and of course he's not afraid you'll starve to death."" ""You don't think so? Can't you tell him I am?"" she retorted. ""Convince him! Speak with your own mind: say you're sure I am!"" ""No, you're forgetting, Mrs. Linton,"" I suggested, ""that you've eaten heartily tonight and will feel the benefits tomorrow."" ""If I were only sure it would kill him,"" she interrupted, ""I'd kill myself right there!"" I haven't slept a wink these three terrible nights—and oh, how it torments me! I'm obsessed, Nelly! But I'm beginning to believe you don't love me."
"How strange! I thought, although they all hated and despised each other, they couldn't help but love me. And they all became enemies within a few hours: That's what they are, these people. How terrible it is to face death, surrounded by their cold faces! Isabella, frightened and repulsed, was afraid to enter the room; how terrible it would be to see Catherine leave."
"And Edgar stood solemnly to finish it; then he thanked God for bringing peace back to his house, and turned again to his books! What can he have to do with books when I am dying? She could not bear the thought of Mr. Linton's philosophical resignation, which I had instilled in her. She tossed and turned, her feverish confusion turning into frenzy, and she tore the pillow with her teeth; then she sat up, all aflame, and begged me to open the window. It was the middle of winter, the wind was blowing hard from the northeast, and I protested."
"Her expression and mood swings began to disturb me terribly, reminding me of her previous illness and the doctor's instructions not to disturb her. A moment ago she had been violent; now, leaning on one arm and unaware that I disobeyed her, she seemed to amuse herself like a child, plucking the feathers from the tears she had just made and arranging them in a fancy manner on the sheet. Her mind was occupied with other associations. ""That's a turkey,"" she murmured; ""And that's a mallard; and that's a pigeon."" Ah, they tuck pigeon feathers into pillows! No wonder I can't die! I have to throw them on the floor when I lie down."
"And here is a moorhen; and this one—I would recognize it among thousands—is a lapwing. A beautiful bird; it's circling above our heads, in the middle of the moor. It was heading for its nest, for the clouds were brushing the waves, and it sensed the rain coming."
"This feather was plucked from the moor, but the bird wasn't shot: We saw its nest in winter, full of small skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap for it, and the old folks didn't dare come. I made him promise never to shoot a lapwing again, and he didn't."
"Yes, there are more here! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are any red? Let's see. ""Don't be so motherly!"" I interrupted, pulling out the pillow and turning the holes toward the mattress, for she was busy emptying the contents by the handful. ""Lie down and close your eyes: you'll get lost. What a mess! The down is flying like snow."" I paced back and forth, gathering them up. ""I see you, Nelly,"" she continued dreamily, ""an old woman: you have gray hair and stooped shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave beneath the rocks of Penistone, and you collect fairy balls to torment our cows; as long as I'm here, you behave as if they were mere threads of wool."""
"In fifty years you will be: I know you are not now. I digress: you are mistaken, otherwise I should think you really were that shriveled witch, and I should think I was beneath Penistone Crags; and I know it is night, and two candles are on the table, illuminating the pitch-black press. ""The black press? Where is it?"" I asked. ""You're talking in your sleep!"" ""It's against the wall, as always,"" she answered. ""It's very strange, I see a face in it!"" ""There is no press in the room, and there never was,"" I said, sitting down again and drawing the curtain so I could look at her. ""Don't you see that face?"" she asked, examining herself gravely in the mirror. And no matter what I said, I couldn't make her understand that it was her own face; so I got up and covered it with a shawl. ""It's still there!"" she continued anxiously. ""And it has moved."""
"Who's there? I hope he doesn't come out while you're gone! Oh! Nelly, the room is haunted! I'm afraid to be alone! I took her hand in mine and told her to stay calm; for a shudder ran through her, and she kept her eyes fixed on the glass. ""There's no one here!"" I insisted. ""It was YOU, Mrs. Linton: you've known that for a while."" ""Me!"" she gasped, ""and the clock strikes twelve! Then it's true! It's horrible!"" Her fingers seized the clothes and pulled them over her eyes. I tried to creep to the door to call her husband; but a piercing scream pulled me back: the shawl had fallen from the frame. ""What's the matter?"" I cried. ""Who is that coward? Wake up!"" It's the glass, the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you recognize yourself in it, and I'm at your side."" Trembling and helpless, she held me tight, but the fear gradually faded from her face; the pallor gave way to a touch of shame. ""Oh dear! I thought I was home,"" she sighed. ""I thought I was in my room at Wuthering Heights. Because I was weak, my mind went wild, and I screamed unconsciously."""
"Don't say anything, but stay with me. I'm afraid to sleep: my dreams worry me. ""A deep sleep would do you good, madam,"" I replied, ""and I hope this suffering saves you from starvation."" ""Oh, if only I were in my bed, in the old house!"" she continued bitterly, wringing her hands. ""And that wind howling in the firs on the trellis. Let me feel it, it comes straight from the moor, let me breathe a little!"" To calm her, I held the window ajar for a few seconds."
"A cold gust of wind blew; I closed the door and returned to my seat. She lay motionless, her face streaming with tears. Physical exhaustion had completely overwhelmed her mind: our feisty Catherine was little more than a weeping child. ""How long has it been since I locked myself in here?"" she asked, suddenly coming to. ""That was Monday night,"" I replied, ""and today is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning."" ""What? In the same week?"" she exclaimed. ""So short?"" ""Long enough to survive on nothing but cold water and a bad temper,"" I remarked. ""Well, that seems like an exhausting number of hours,"" she murmured doubtfully. ""It must be more."""
"I still remember being in the living room after their argument, where Edgar cruelly mocked me and I ran around the room frantically. As soon as I locked the door, deep darkness overcame me, and I collapsed. I couldn't explain to Edgar how certain I was that if he continued to tease me, I would have a fit or go completely mad! I had no control over my tongue or my mind, and perhaps he didn't suspect my fear: it barely gave me the strength to flee from him and his voice."
"Before I could see or hear well enough again, I had an epiphany, and Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought and what kept coming back to me until I was scared to death. I lay there, my head leaning against the table leg, my eyes only vaguely making out the gray square of the window. I thought I was home in that oak bed. And my heart broke with profound sadness: as soon as I woke up, I couldn't remember. I pondered, pondered, tried to figure out what it could be, and, the strangest thing of all: the last seven years of my life had been like an empty void! I couldn't even remember that they had been like that."
"I was a child; my father had just been buried, and my unhappiness stemmed from the separation ordered by Hindley between me and Heathcliff. I was buried alone for the first time; and, awoke from a troubled sleep after a night of weeping, I raised my hand to part the tablets: it struck the tabletop! I passed it across the carpet, and suddenly the memory returned: my former anguish was swallowed up by a wave of despair. I cannot say why I felt so terribly unhappy; it must have been a temporary madness, for there is scarcely any reason for it."
"But imagine if, at twelve, I had been torn from the High Plains, from all my first contacts, from everything else, like Heathcliff then, and changed at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the mistress of Thrushcross Grange and the wife of a stranger: an exile, an outcast, from that moment, from what had been my world. Imagine, you should have seen the abyss into which I had withdrawn! Shake your head, Nelly, you have unsettled me! You should have talked to Edgar, really, and made him leave me alone! Oh, I'm burning! I wish I were out! I wish I were a young girl again, half-wild, brave and free; laughing at insults, not mad! Why have I changed so? Why does my blood race at the slightest word? I am sure I would be myself if I were ever in the heather of these hills. Open the window wide! Quick, why don't you go? ""Because I don't want you to freeze,"" I replied. ""You mean you're not giving me a chance to live,"" she said grumpily. ""But I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself."" And before I could stop her, she slid out of bed, strode across the room, threw it back, and leaned forward, indifferent to the icy air that cut into her shoulders like a knife."
"I begged her and finally tried to force her to retreat. But I soon realized that her madness far exceeded mine (she was mad, as her subsequent actions and delusions clearly showed me). There was no moon, and everything below was in misty darkness: no light shone from any house, near or far; everything had long since gone out. And the houses of Wuthering Heights were nowhere to be seen—and yet she claimed to have glimpsed the light from them. ""Look!"" she cried eagerly, ""that is my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's attic."""
"Joseph stays up late, doesn't he? He's waiting for me to come home to close the gate. Well, he'll wait a little longer. It's a difficult, sad journey; and one has to go through Gimmerton Church to complete it! We've often braved his ghosts together, daring each other to stand among the graves and invite them to come."
"But, Heathcliff, if I challenge you now, will you dare? If so, I'll keep you. I won't stay there alone: They may bury me three meters deep and tear down the church over me, but I won't rest until you come. Never! She paused and continued with a strange smile. ""He's thinking—he'd rather I came to him! So find a way! Not through this cemetery."""
"""You are slow! Be content, you have always followed me!"" I realized it was useless to argue with her madness and was seeking some way of binding her without yielding (for I could not trust her through the gaping grate alone), when, to my great horror, I heard the rattle of the doorknob and Mr. Linton's entrance. He was coming from the library; crossing the hall, he had noticed our conversation and, from curiosity or fear at this late hour, had inquired its meaning. ""Oh, sir!"" I cried, suppressing the exclamation that escaped him at the sight before his eyes and the gloomy atmosphere of the room. ""My poor mistress is ill, and she is entirely my mistress: I can do nothing for her; come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she is difficult to control, except her own."" ""Catherine is ill?"" he asked, hurrying towards us. “Close the window, Ellen! Catherine!” Why…” He paused."
"Mrs. Linton's emaciated appearance left him speechless, and his gaze could only stare at her and then at me, full of horror and astonishment. ""She's complaining here,"" I continued, ""she hardly eats and never complains: until this evening she hasn't let anyone in, and that's why we couldn't inform you of her condition, as we ourselves knew nothing about it; but it's nothing."" I found my explanations clumsy; the gentleman frowned. ""It's nothing, isn't it, Ellen Dean?"" he said sternly. ""You'll have to justify yourself even more than you have, for leaving me in the dark!"" He took his wife in his arms and looked at her anxiously. At first, she didn't recognize him at first glance; he was invisible to her distracted gaze. But her delirium had not subsided; having left the darkness, she gradually turned her attention back to him and discovered who was holding her. ""Ah! They're here, aren't they, Edgar Linton?"" she said with furious fervor. ""You're one of those creatures you always find when you least want them, and never when they want you! I suppose we shall have much to complain about now—I can see that—but they can't keep me from going to my narrow house outside: my resting place, where I go before the spring is over! Here it is: not to the Lintons', mind you, under the roof of the chapel, but out in the open, with a tombstone; and you can choose whether you go to them or to me!"" ""Catherine, what have you done?"" began the gentleman. ""Am I nothing to you? Do you love this miserable Heath—"" ""Shh!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""Shh, now!"" If you speak that name, I'll put an end to it all at once by jumping out of the window! What you touch now is yours; but my soul will be on that hill before you catch me again."""
"I don't need you, Edgar. I haven't needed you in a long time. Go back to work. I'm glad you've calmed down, because whatever attraction you had for me is gone. ""Her mind is wandering, sir,"" I interrupted. ""She's been talking nonsense all evening; but let her be quiet and listen carefully, and she'll calm down."""
"""From now on, you must be careful how you disturb her."" ""I need no further advice from you,"" replied Mr. Linton. ""You knew your mistress's temper and encouraged me to disturb her. And you haven't let me know the slightest bit about her condition for the past three days! It was cruel! Months of illness could not have brought about such a change!"" I began to defend myself, feeling it a pity to be accused of someone else's malice. ""I knew Mrs. Linton was willful and domineering,"" I exclaimed, ""but I didn't know you were trying to stir up her passion! I didn't know I would wink at Mr. Heathcliff to please her. I have fulfilled my duty as a faithful servant by telling you this, and I have a faithful servant's reward! Well, this will be a lesson to me to be careful next time."""
"Next time, get your own information! ""The next time you tell me a story, you must leave my service, Ellen Dean,"" he replied. ""Then I suppose you'd rather not hear it, Mr. Linton?"" I asked. ""Heathcliff has your permission to pay court to Miss and visit her on every occasion of your absence, to turn the mistress against you?"" Despondent as she was, Catherine was aware of the idea of making our conversation a topic. ""Ah! Nelly has betrayed me!"" she cried passionately. ""Nelly is my secret enemy. Witch! Then you are looking for fairy lightning to harm us! Let me go, and I will make her repent! I will make her recant!"" Wild rage seized her; she struggled desperately to free herself from Linton's arms. Seeing no reason to delay the event, I determined to seek medical help myself and left the room."
"As I crossed the garden to reach the street, I noticed something white moving erratically. Apparently, it wasn't the wind, but a bridle driven into the wall. Despite my haste, I paused to examine it, fearing that one day I would be convinced it was a creature from another world. My surprise and confusion were great when I discovered Miss Isabella's little springer spaniel, Fanny, hanging from a handkerchief, near death, more by touch than by sight."
"I quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up the stairs as she went to bed; and I wondered how it had gotten there and what wicked person had treated it so. As I untied the knot in the hook, I thought I heard the rhythm of galloping horse hooves in the distance several times; but so many things preoccupied me that I hardly noticed it, even though it was a strange sound in that place at two in the morning."
"Fortunately, Mr. Kenneth had just left his house to visit a patient in the village when I stepped out onto the street. My account of Catherine Linton's illness prompted him to return with me immediately. He was a rather outspoken man; he didn't hesitate to express his doubts about whether she would survive this second attack if she didn't obey his instructions even more strictly than before. ""Nelly Dean,"" he said, ""I can't help thinking there's another reason for this. What happened at the Grange? We have some strange news here."""
"A strong, robust girl like Catherine doesn't get sick for nothing; and neither should such people. It's hard work helping them with fevers and the like. How did it all begin? ""The Lord will tell you,"" I replied; ""but you know the Earnshaws' aggressive temper, and Mrs. Linton is the icing on the cake."""
"All I can say is: It all started with an argument. She had a tantrum during a tantrum. At least, that's her story: At the height of the attack, she ran away and locked herself in."
"After that, she refused to eat and now vacillates between wandering and daydreaming; she knows the people around her, but her head is full of strange ideas and illusions. ""Will Mr. Linton regret it?"" Kenneth asked questioningly. ""I regret it? It would break her heart if anything happened!"" I replied. ""Don't worry him more than necessary."" ""Well, I told him to be careful,"" said my companion; ""and he must suffer the consequences of his indifference to my warning! Hasn't he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff lately?"" ""Heathcliff is a frequent guest at the Grange,"" I replied, ""but more because the mistress knew him as a child than because the master enjoys his company. For the time being, he is exempt from visits, thanks to some presumptuous requests he has expressed to Miss Linton."" I don't think he will be kissed again. ""And Miss Linton turns her back on him?"" was the doctor's next question. ""I don't trust her,"" I replied, hesitating to continue. ""No, she's a shrewd woman,"" he remarked, shaking his head. ""She keeps her opinions to herself! But she's a real idiot."""
"I have it on good authority that last night (and it was a fine night!) she and Heathcliff walked for over two hours in the grass behind your house; and he urged her not to turn back, but simply to mount and walk! My informant told me the only way to dissuade him was to give her his word of honor to be ready for their next meeting: when she arrived, he heard nothing; but you urge Mr. Linton to be on his guard! This news filled me with new anxiety; I overtook Kenneth and ran almost all the way home. The little dog was still whining in the garden. I took a moment to open the gate for him, but instead of going to the front door, he paced up and down, sniffing the grass, and would have run out into the street if I hadn't grabbed him and carried him inside."
"When I reached Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty. If I'd been there a few hours earlier, Mrs. Linton's illness might have prevented her from leaving so quickly. But what could I do now? I had little chance of catching them if they were immediately pursued."
"However, I couldn't pursue them; and I didn't dare wake the family and stir up tensions, let alone speak of them to my master, who was so absorbed in his present misfortune and incapable of a second sorrow! I saw no other option than to remain silent and let things take their course; and when Kenneth arrived, I went to his house in a bad mood to announce him. Catherine slept restlessly: her husband had managed to calm his excessive fury; now he hovered over his pillow, observing every shadow and every change in his painfully expressive features. The doctor, who was investigating the case himself, told her hopefully that the outcome would be favorable if we could only provide her with complete and constant rest."
"He meant that the impending danger was not so much death as a permanent mental alienation. I did not sleep a wink that night, nor did Mr. Linton; we did not go to bed at all; and the servants were all up long before the usual time, stealing stealthily about the house and exchanging whispered words whenever they met at work. Everyone was busy except Miss Isabella; and they noticed that she was fast asleep. Her brother, too, asked her if she was awake and seemed impatient with her presence, mortified that she cared so little for her sister-in-law."
"I trembled lest he should send for her; but I need not suffer the agony of being the first to announce her escape. One of the maids, a thoughtless young woman who had started early for Gimmerton, came panting upstairs with her mouth wide open, burst into the room, and cried: ""Oh dear! What is the matter? Sir, sir, our young lady—"" ""Be quiet!"" I cried hastily, incensed at her effusive behavior. ""Speak more quietly, Mary—what is the matter?"" demanded Mr. Linton. ""What is the matter with your young lady?"" ""She's gone, she's gone! That Heathcliff has run away with her!"" cried the girl. ""It's not true!"" cried Linton, rising in agitation. ""It's impossible: what makes you think so? Ellen Dean, go and see her."" It's incredible: it's impossible."" As he spoke, he led the maid to the door and repeated his question as to why she had said that. ""Well, on my way to get milk, I met a boy,"" she stammered, ""and he asked us if we were having any problems at the Grange."""
"I thought he meant the lady was ill, and said, ""Yes."" Then he said, ""Someone's been following her, I suppose?"" I looked at him intently. He saw I knew nothing about it and told me how, just after midnight, a man and a woman had stopped at a blacksmith's two miles from Gimmerton to have a horseshoe made! And how the farrier's wife had gotten up to see who they were: she knew them both personally."
"And she saw the man—it was Heathcliff, she was sure; besides, no one could mistake him—press a sovereign into her father's hand as payment. The lady had wrapped a cloak around her face; but after asking for a drink of water, it fell back as she drank, and she looked completely changed. Heathcliff held both reins as they rode on, and they left the village as quickly as the bumpy roads allowed."
"The girl didn't tell her father, but this morning she told all of Gimmerton. I ran and, for formality's sake, peeped into Isabella's room. When I returned, I confirmed the servant's statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his position by the bed. When I returned, he looked up, guessed my blank expression, and lowered his eyes without giving an order or saying a word. ""Shall we do something to catch her and bring her back?"" I asked. ""How?"" ""She left of her own free will,"" replied the master; ""she had every right to go if she wanted to. Don't bother me with her again."""
"From now on, she is my sister in name only: not because I have cast her out, but because she has cast me out."" And that was all he said on the subject: he asked no further questions or mentioned her in any way, except that he ordered her to send all her belongings to her new home, wherever that may be, as soon as I know. For two months the refugees remained absent; during those two months Mrs. Linton endured and overcame the most dreadful shock of what is called encephalitis. No mother could have cared for an only child with such devotion as Edgar had cared for his."
"Day and night he watched, patiently enduring all the discomforts that frayed nerves and a troubled mind could bring. And although Kenneth realized that what he had saved from the grave would only compensate for his fears by filling him with constant anxiety about the future—that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a devastated humanity—he felt boundless gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared saved. Hour after hour, he sat by her side, watching her gradually regain physical health and comforting her overly optimistic hopes with the illusion that her mind, too, would soon regain its balance and she would soon be herself again. The first time she left her room was early in March of the following year. Mr. Linton had placed a handful of golden crocuses on her pillow that morning. Her eyes, long without a glimmer of joy, caught sight of them upon waking and beamed with joy as she eagerly plucked them. ""These are the first flowers of the heights,"" she exclaimed. ""They remind me of the gentle dew, the warm sun, and the almost melted snow."""
"Edgar, isn't the south wind blowing, and isn't the snow almost gone? 'Here the snow is all gone, my dear,' replied her husband; 'and I see only two white patches on the whole heath: the sky is blue, the larks are singing, and the streams are overflowing. Catherine, last spring, at this time, I longed to have you under this roof; now I wish you were a few miles away, on these hills: the air blows so sweet that it would heal you.' 'I will never come here more than once,' said the sick man; 'and then you will leave me, and I will stay forever. Next spring you will long to have me under this roof, and you will remember how happy you were today.' Linton showered her with his tenderest caresses and tried to console her with the sweetest words; But as she glanced at the flowers, tears gathered in her eyelashes and carelessly ran down her cheeks."
"We knew she was really improving and therefore concluded that her prolonged confinement to one and the same place was largely responsible for her depression, and that a change of air might alleviate it somewhat. The professor instructed me to light a fire in the parlor, which had been deserted for weeks, and to place a comfortable armchair by the window in the sun. He then led her downstairs, and there she sat for a long time, enjoying the pleasant warmth. As expected, the objects around her comforted her: although familiar, they were far removed from the grim memories that surrounded her hated sickroom. Towards evening, she seemed exhausted; but no amount of persuasion could induce her to return to the room, and I had to make a bed for her on the parlor sofa until another room was ready."
"To avoid the effort of climbing stairs, we arranged the place where you now lie on the same floor as the living room. Soon she was strong enough to walk from one floor to another, supported by Edgar's arm. Ah! I thought she would recover if she was well cared for. And there was a double reason to hope so, for someone else's existence depended on her: We cherished the hope that Mr. Linton would soon be satisfied, and his fortune would be saved from the clutches of a stranger thanks to the birth of an heir."
"It should be noted that about six weeks before her departure, Isabella had sent her brother a short note announcing her marriage to Heathcliff. The text seemed cold and dry, but at the end was a vague, penciled apology, accompanied by a request for remembrance and reconciliation if her behavior had offended him. She claimed she could do nothing about it at the time, and now that she was done, she had no power to reverse her decision. I don't think Linton replied; and two weeks later, I received a long letter, which I found odd, written by a bride returning from her honeymoon."
"I'll read it because I'll always keep it. Every relic of a dead person is precious if you cherish it while you're still alive. DEAR ELLEN, it begins like this: ""I arrived at Wuthering Heights last night and learned for the first time that Catherine was, and still is, gravely ill."""
"I don't think I'm allowed to write to him, and my brother is either too angry or too upset to reply to my message. But I must write to someone, and there's no one left but you. Tell Edgar that I would give anything to see him again—that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange within 24 hours of my leaving, and is now there, filled with tenderness for him and Catherine! I cannot follow, even if—(these words are underlined)—they do not have to wait for me and can draw their own conclusions; but see that my weakness of will or lack of affection does not embarrass me."
"The rest of this letter is addressed to you alone. I have two questions to ask you: First, how have you managed to retain human sympathy here? I detect no feelings shared by those around you. The second question interests me greatly: Is Mr. Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I will not reveal the reasons for this question, but I earnestly beg you, if possible, to explain to me to whom I am married: that is, when you come to visit me; and you must come very soon, Ellen."
"Don't write to me, but bring me something from Edgar. Now you'll learn how I was welcomed into my new home, exactly as I imagine it in the Heights. For entertainment, I reflect on topics like the lack of external comforts: they never concern me, except when I miss them."
"I would laugh and dance for joy if I discovered that her absence was the culmination of my misfortune, and the rest a supernatural dream! The sun was setting behind the manor as we turned toward the moor; from then on, I judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion remained for half an hour, inspecting the park, the gardens, and probably the place itself, as best he could; thus, it was dark when we landed in the paved court, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, came to meet us by candlelight. He did this with a courtesy that did him credit. His first act was to thrust the torch into my face, wink spitefully, curl his lip, and turn away."
"Then he took the two horses and led them to the stable; when he returned, he locked the outer door as if we were living in an old castle. Heathcliff stayed to talk with him, and I went into the kitchen—a dirty, cluttered study; I bet you wouldn't notice, so changed has it been since you left it. By the fire stood a naughty child, stout and in dirty clothes, with a Catherine look in her eyes and on her mouth. ""This is Edgar's legitimate nephew,"" I thought—""mine in a way; I must shake his hand and—yes—I must kiss him."""
"""It's good to make good contact at the beginning."" I walked over, tried to grab his thick fist, and asked, ""How are you, my dear?"" He answered in gibberish I didn't understand. ""Shall we be friends, Hareton?"" was my next attempt at conversation. A curse and the threat of sending Throttler after me if I didn't run away rewarded my persistence. ""Hey, Throttler, boy!"" muttered the little brat, dragging a bulldog mix from its den in a corner. ""Now, are you going to get to work?"" he demanded imperiously. The love of my life forced me to agree; I crossed the threshold to wait for the others to come in."
"Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere to be seen; and Joseph, whom I had followed to the stables, and invited to come in with me, after staring and muttering, wrinkled his nose and answered, ""Mim! Mim! Mim! Did a Christian ever hear of such a thing? Clacking and clacking! How shall I know what you say?"" ""I tell you, I will have you come in with me!"" I cried, believing him deaf, but deeply indignant at his discourtesy. ""Not from me! I have other things to do,"" he replied, continuing his work. Meanwhile, waving the beam of his lantern, he examined my clothes and my face (the one much too fine, but the other, I am sure, as piteous as he could wish) with the utmost contempt. I walked around the courtyard and through a small door to another, where I allowed myself to knock, hoping another official would appear. After a moment of waiting, a tall, thin man opened the door. He wore no headscarf and was completely disheveled. His face was lost in a mass of matted hair that fell over his shoulders. His eyes, too, resembled those of a ghostly Catherine, her beauty completely destroyed. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked gloomily. ""Who are you?"" ""My name was Isabella Linton,"" I replied. ""You've seen me before, sir."""
"I recently married Mr. Heathcliff, and he brought me here, presumably with your permission. ""So he's back?"" asked the hermit, furious as a hungry wolf. ""Yes, we just arrived,"" I said; ""but he dropped me off at the kitchen door; and when I was about to go in, your little boy was standing guard and chased me out with the help of a bulldog. Fortunately, that scoundrel kept his word!"" growled my prospective host, peering into the darkness behind me, expecting to find Heathcliff; then he launched into a monologue of curses and threats about what he would have done if the ""devil"" had betrayed him. I regretted this second attempt and was almost tempted to slip away before he had finished cursing, but before I could carry out my resolution, he bade me enter, closed the door, and locked it again. A large fire burned and was the only light in the enormous apartment. The floor had turned a solid gray. Even the once-gleaming pewter dishes that had caught my eye as a child had been plunged into a similar darkness by dirt and dust."
"I asked if I could call the chambermaid and have her show me a room! Mr. Earnshaw didn't answer. He paced the room with his hands in his pockets, apparently utterly unaware of my presence; and his absence was so marked and his manner so misanthropic that I hesitated to disturb him again. It will not surprise you, Ellen, that I felt particularly oppressed as I sat in more than profound solitude in the corner of that inhospitable fireplace, thinking that my beautiful home, with the only people I loved in the world, was only four miles away; and as far as the Atlantic separated us, instead of those four miles: I could not cross it! I asked myself: Where would I find comfort? And—mind you, don't tell Edgar or Catherine this—most of all, I was pained by the despair of finding no one who could or would ally me against Heathcliff! I would have been almost glad to find refuge at Wuthering Heights, for, thanks to that arrangement, I would not have had to live alone with him. But he knew the people we were visiting and wasn't afraid that they might disturb us."
"I sat there, reflecting on a sad moment: The clock struck eight, nine, and my companion continued pacing the room, his head bowed on his chest, completely motionless, only occasionally uttering bitter sighs or exclamations. I waited for a woman's voice in the house and filled the pause with angry regret and gloomy anticipation, which finally expressed itself in uncontrollable sighs and tears. I didn't realize how obvious my grief was until Earnshaw stopped in front of me with measured steps and looked at me with a look of renewed surprise."
"Taking advantage of his renewed attention, I cried, ""I am tired with the journey and wish to go to bed! Where is the chambermaid? Take me to her, for she refuses to come to me!"" ""We have none,"" he replied; ""you must take care of yourself!"" ""Then where shall I sleep?"" I sobbed; I had already exceeded the bounds of my self-respect, crushed by weariness and despair. ""Joseph will show you Heathcliff's room,"" he said; ""open the door, there he is."" I was about to obey, but he stopped me abruptly and added in a strange tone, ""Be so good as to close your lock and draw the bolt—don't do that!"" ""Well!"" I asked. ""But why, Mr. Earnshaw?"" I had no wish to deliberately bind myself to Heathcliff. ""You see!"" ""He replied, pulling from his vest a strangely constructed pistol with a double-edged, spring-loaded knife on the barrel. ""That's a real temptation for a desperate man, isn't it? I can't help going upstairs with it every night and trying to open his door. When I find it open, he's furious; I always do, even if I've already thought of a thousand and one reasons not to: he's a demon urging me to thwart my own plans by killing him. Fight this demon for love while you can; when the time comes, all the angels in heaven won't save him!"" I examined the weapon carefully."
"A terrible thought struck me: How powerful I would be with such a tool! I took it from his hand and touched the blade. He seemed surprised by the expression that instantly came over my face: It wasn't disgust, it was greed. Jealously, he drew the gun, closed the knife, and put it back in its hiding place. ""I don't care if you tell him,"" he said. ""Keep him on guard and watch him."""
"You know our position, I see: his danger does not shock you. ""What has Heathcliff done to you?"" I asked. ""What has he done to you to justify this vile hatred? Would it not be wiser to ask him to leave the house?"" ""No!"" thundered Earnshaw. ""If he proposes to leave me, he is lost. Persuade him to try, and you are a murderer! Am I to lose everything, with no chance of recovery? Am I to become a beggar? Oh, good heavens! I shall have him back; and I shall have his gold too; and then his blood; and hell will have his soul! It will be ten times blacker for that man than ever! You have initiated me into your old master's ways, Ellen. He is clearly on the verge of madness: at least, he was last night. I shuddered at the thought of his proximity, and found the servant's rude and uncouth behavior rather agreeable."
"He resumed his grumpy pacing, and I pulled the latch to slip into the kitchen. Joseph leaned over the fire and peered into a large pot hanging over it; beside it stood a wooden bowl of porridge on the bench. The contents of the pot began to boil, and he turned to dip his hand in. I guessed this dish was probably intended for our supper, and since I was hungry, I thought it must be edible. So I called out sharply, ""I'm making the porridge!"" I placed the pot out of his reach and began to take off my hat and overalls. ""Mr. Earnshaw,"" I continued, ""orders me to help myself. I will."""
"""I won't pretend to be the lady among you for fear of starving."" ""Good God!"" he murmured, sitting down and smoothing his ribbed stockings from knee to ankle. ""When the new world comes—just when I'm getting used to two masters, when I have a LADY over me—it's time to run away. I never thought I could leave this place—but I doubt it will be soon!"" This complaint left me unheeded: I hurried to work, sighing at the memory of a time when all had been joy; but I had to banish the memory quickly. The memory of past happiness tormented me, and the greater the danger of remembering it, the faster the rod spun and the faster the handfuls of flour fell into the water."
"Joseph watched me cook with growing indignation. ""Hey!"" he shouted. ""Hareton, you're not eating your porridge; it's just lumps the size of my belly."" ""Hey, man! If I were you, I'd put it all in a bowl! Here, pale with guilt, because after that, it's all over."" Boom, boom."
"Fortunately, the froth didn't dry out! I confess it was a real mess when the milk was poured into the bowls; four had been set out, and a jug of fresh milk was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and began to drink, the milk flowing over the wide rim. I protested, wishing he would drink his from a jug; I assured him that I couldn't taste the mistreated liquid. The old cynic was deeply offended by this politeness; he assured me several times that ""the barn was just as good"" as I was, ""and just as woolly,"" and wondered how I could be so conceited."
"Meanwhile, the little rascal continued drinking, giving me a defiant look as he drooled into his glass. ""I'm eating in another room,"" I said. ""Don't you have a living room?"" ""Parreau!"" he repeated mockingly. ""Parreau! No, we don't have a living room. In case you don't know where we are, this is the master's house; and in case you don't know where we are, here we are."" ""Then I'll go upstairs,"" I replied; ""show me a room."" I put my bowl on a tray and fetched some milk myself. Grumbling, the man got up and led the way. We went up to the attic, opening a door every now and then to peek into the rooms we passed. ""Here's a cream,"" he said finally, pushing aside a small, rickety shelf. ""There's enough porridge to eat."""
"""There's a bundle of grain in the corner, my dear and honorable family; if you're afraid of soiling your heavy silk coats, spread your handkerchief over them."" The ""cream"" was a sort of storeroom that smelled strongly of malt and grain; various sacks of things were stacked all around it, leaving a large empty space in the middle. ""Good heavens!"" I cried, staring at him, ""this is no place to sleep. I want to see my room."" ""BEDROOM!"" he repeated mockingly. ""You can see the whole BEDROOM here—it's mine."" He pointed to the second attic, which differed from the first only in having fewer covered walls and a large, low bed without curtains, with an indigo quilt on one side. ""What would you like me to do with yours?"" I replied. ""I suppose Mr. Heathcliff doesn't live upstairs, does he?"" ""Oh! Are you looking for Master Heathcliff's room?"" he cried, as if he had made a new discovery. ""Couldn't you have told me right away? I could have told you, but with all the work, there's only one room you can't see: he locks it so no one but himself can hear it."" ""You have a beautiful house, Joseph,"" I couldn't help remarking, ""and lovely residents; and I think the epitome of all the madness in the world took root in my mind the day I joined my fate to theirs! But that's not the point: there are other rooms. Come quickly and let me live somewhere!"" He didn't respond to this incantation; he simply trudged down the wooden stairs and stopped outside a room that I considered the best for its peace and quality of furnishings."
"There was a carpet—a beautiful carpet, but its pattern discolored by dust; a mantelpiece littered with scraps of paper; a fine oak bedstead hung with wide, crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern manufacture; but they had obviously been badly treated: the flounces hung in loops torn from their rings, and the iron rod that held them was twisted at one end, so that the curtains dragged on the floor. The chairs, too, were damaged, often heavy, and deep dents warped the wainscoting. I was about to go in and take them when my rather foolish guide announced, ""This is from the master."" My dinner was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience at an end."
"I insisted on finding refuge and a place to rest immediately. ""Where in God's name?"" began the spiritual elder. ""The Lord bless us! May he forgive us! Where are you? You maimed, tiresome wretches! You've seen everything except Hareton's little fellow. There's no room to sleep in this prison!"" I was so angry that I threw my tray and its contents to the floor. Then I sat down on the steps with my hands over my face and screamed. ""Oh! Oh!"" cried Joseph. ""Well done, Miss Cathy! Well done, Miss Cathy! But the Master will overturn these pots. And then we'll hear the end of it; we'll hear how it's meant to be. Nonsense! You shall never miss Christmas again and throw away God's precious gifts in your furious rage! But I am wrong when you show your strength."""
"Do you think Hathecliff will behave so well? I truly hope he doesn't surprise you there. I truly hope he doesn't surprise you."" So he continued his rebukes in his hiding place, taking the candle with him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection that followed this foolish act forced me to realize that I must suppress my pride and anger and try to eliminate the consequences."
"Soon an unexpected assistant appeared in the form of Throttler, whom I now recognized as the son of our old Skulker: he had spent his childhood at the Grange and had been placed with Mr. Hindley by my father. I suppose he knew me: he gave me a gentle elbow nudge in greeting and then hurried off to eat the porridge, while I staggered from step to step, picking up broken dishes and wiping the milk splashes on the banisters with my handkerchief. Our work was hardly finished when I heard Earnshaw's footsteps in the hall; my assistant tucked his tail between his legs and pressed himself against the wall; I squeezed myself into the nearest doorway."
"The dog's attempt to evade him failed; as I had suspected, a rustling downstairs and a long, pitiful whine drove him to flee. I had better luck: he continued on his way, entered his room, and closed the door. Immediately afterwards, Joseph went upstairs with Hareton to put him to bed."
"I had sought refuge in Hareton's room, and when the old man saw me, he said, ""They are kind to you, your pride, and now I think the house is empty. It is empty; you can keep it to yourself, while He makes us a third party in such bad company!"" I gladly took advantage of this information, and as soon as I sank into an armchair by the fire, I dozed off and fell asleep. My sleep was deep and sweet, though too quick."
"Mr. Heathcliff woke me; he had just come in and asked me kindly what I was doing there. I explained to him why I had stayed up so late: he had the key to our room in his pocket. The adjective ""our"" was terribly insulting. He swore it was not mine and never would be mine; and he did, but I shall not repeat his words, nor describe his usual behavior: he is resourceful and unwearying in his efforts to excite my horror! Sometimes I marvel at him with an intensity that numbs my fears; yet, I assure you, a tiger or a poisonous snake could not frighten me so much."
"He told me about Catherine's illness and accused my brother of being the cause. He promised to take Edgar's place in his suffering until he could cure him. I truly hate him, I'm unhappy, I've been stupid! Be careful not to tell anyone at the Grange. I wait for you every day, don't disappoint me! – ISABELLA."
"As soon as I read this letter, I went to the Lord and told him of his sister's arrival at Wuthering Heights. She wrote me a letter expressing her sorrow at Mrs. Linton's situation and her ardent desire to see him again. She wished him to convey to her a token of my forgiveness as soon as possible. ""Forgive me!"" said Linton. ""I have nothing to forgive her for, Ellen. You can call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and tell her that I am not angry, but sorry to have lost her; especially since I cannot imagine her being happy. A visit to her, however, is out of the question: we are separated forever; and if she really wishes to do me a favor, she should persuade the scoundrel she married to leave the country."" ""And you will not write her a word, sir?"" I asked imploringly. ""No,"" he replied. ""That is superfluous."""
"My contact with Heathcliff's family will be as rare as with my own. There will be none at all! Mr. Edgar's coldness oppressed me deeply; and all the way from the Grange, I wondered how I could add depth to his words and soften his refusal to offer even a few words of comfort to Isabella. I imagine she had been watching me since morning: I saw her peering through the trellis as I entered the garden and nodded to her; but she shrank back, as if afraid of being seen."
"I entered without knocking. Never before had I seen such a gloomy and sad sight as in this once cheerful house! I must admit that if I were in the young woman's place, I would have at least swept the fireplace and dusted the tables. But she was already contributing to the great disorder that surrounded her."
"Her beautiful face was pale and lifeless; her hair was loose, some strands hanging tangled, others disheveled. She probably hadn't touched her dress since the previous day. Hindley wasn't there."
"Mr. Heathcliff was sitting at a table, leafing through his purse. When I arrived, he stood up, politely inquired how I was, and offered me a chair. He was the only decent-looking man there, and I thought he had never looked so good. Circumstances had so changed their situation that he would have seemed to me a true gentleman, and his wife a real tramp! She came eagerly forward to greet me and held out her hand for the expected letter."
"I shook my head. She didn't understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard. I placed my hat there and muttered something imploring me to give her what I had brought directly. Heathcliff guessed her intention and said, ""If you have anything for Isabella (and I'm sure you do, Nelly), then give it to her."""
"""You needn't make a secret of it: we have no secrets from each other."" ""Oh, I have none,"" I replied, preferring to tell the truth at once. ""My master has instructed me to tell his sister that she needs no letters or visits from him at the moment. He sends you his regards, Madam, and apologizes for the distress you have caused; but he feels that after this time, his household and this household must break off all contact, as it will no longer be possible to maintain it."" Mrs. Heathcliff's lips trembled slightly, and she returned to her seat by the window. Her husband stood beside me on the mantelpiece and began to question me about Catherine."
"I told him everything I thought about her illness, and under cross-examination, he extracted most of the facts about the cause. I blamed her, as she deserved, for everything going wrong and finally hoped he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid all contact with his family in the future, for better or for worse. ""Mrs. Linton is hardly recovering,"" I told him. ""She will never be the same, but her life has been spared. And if you have any real respect for her, you will never see her again; nay, you will leave this country altogether. And lest you should repent, I tell you that Catherine Linton is now as different from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw as this young lady is from me. Her appearance has changed much, her character even more; and he who is compelled to nurse her can retain her affection in the afterlife only by the memory of what she once was, by simple humanity and a sense of duty!"" ""It's quite possible,"" Heathcliff remarked, trying to appear calm. ""It's quite possible that your master has nothing at his disposal but humanity and a sense of duty."""
"But do you think I will leave Catherine to her DUTY and HUMANITY? And can you compare my feelings for Catherine with hers? Before you leave this house, I must make you promise to arrange a meeting with her: whether you agree or not, I will see her! What do you say to that? 'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you cannot; you never will for my sake. Another meeting between you and the gentleman would utterly destroy her.' 'With your help, that can be avoided,' he continued; 'and even if there were the slightest danger of such an event—even if it would add but one more annoyance to her life—well, I believe I have a right to go through with it! I wish you would be so honest as to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from this loss: the fear of her suffering holds me back.' And there you see the difference between our feelings: if he had been in my place and I in his, I would never have attacked him, even if I had hated him with a hatred that would have turned my life to bile."
"You may appear incredulous if you like! I would never have banished him from her society as long as she wished it. The moment she looked at me, I would have torn out her heart and drunk her blood! But by then—if you don't believe me, you don't know me—by then I would have died inches above her head!—""And yet,"" I interrupted, ""you have no scruple about destroying all hope of a complete cure, by digging into her recollections now that she has almost forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and sorrow.""—""Do you think she has almost forgotten me?"" he said. ""Ah, Nelly! You know! You know as well as I that for every thought she gives to Linton, she gives me a thousand!"" At a very miserable period of my life, I had this thought: it haunted me when I returned to the district last summer; but only its own certainty could induce me to allow that dreadful thought again. And then Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams I once dreamed."
"Two words would describe my future: DEATH and HELL. After losing her, my life would be hell. But I was foolish to believe for a moment that Edgar Linton's affection was worth more to her than mine. Even if he loved his little creature with all his might, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I do in a single day."
"And Catherine's heart is as deep as mine: the sea might as well be trapped in this trough as for him to claim all her affection. Phew! He is scarcely dearer to her than her dog or her horse. It is not her way to be loved as I am: how can she love in him what he has not? ""Catherine and Edgar love each other as much as two people can!"" cried Isabel with sudden vigor. ""No one has the right to speak so, and I will not suffer my brother to degrade me in private!"" ""Your brother has a strange attachment for you too, does he not?"" remarked Heathcliff contemptuously. ""He makes you roam the world with surprising passion."" ""He does not know what I suffer,"" she answered. ""I have not told him."" ""Then you have said something to him? You have written to him, have you not?"" ""To say that I am married, I wrote—you have read it."" ""And nothing since?"" ""No."" ""My young wife looks pitiful in her condition,"" I remarked. ""Of course someone is cheating on her. By whom, I suspect; but perhaps I had better not say."" ""I suspect it was her own love,"" said Heathcliff. ""She's becoming a tramp! She's tired of pleasing me so quickly."""
"You won't believe it, but the very day after our wedding, she was crying because she finally wanted to come home. But she's all the more suited to this house because she's not particularly nice, and I'll make sure she doesn't disgrace me by wandering around. ""Well, sir,"" I replied, ""I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is used to being well cared for and looked after; and that she was raised as an only child and wanted to please everyone. You must give her a maid to keep everything clean, and you must treat her kindly."""
"Whatever your opinion of Mr. Edgar, you have no doubt that she possesses a strong capacity for attachment; otherwise, she would not have renounced the elegance, comfort, and friends of her old homeland to settle peacefully with you in such a wilderness. ""She has renounced them out of madness,"" he replied, ""by representing me as a heroine of romance and hoping to gain unlimited favor from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly consider her a rational being, so obstinate is she in forming a fabulous image of me and acting on the false impressions she has entertained. But I think she is finally beginning to know me: I no longer see the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first, nor that foolish inability to recognize that I was serious when I told her my opinion of her infatuation and of herself."""
"It was a wonderful trick to discover that I didn't love her. I once believed she could learn nothing! And yet it was ill-learned; for this morning, with terrible intelligence, she announced that I had succeeded in making her hate me! A Herculean task, I assure you! If I succeed, I shall have every reason to thank her. Can I trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I leave you alone for half a day, don't you come back to me sighing and coaxing? I suppose she would have preferred that I radiate only tenderness for you: it wounds her vanity when the truth comes to light."
"But I don't care that it becomes known that this passion was only one-sided: and I never lied to her about it. She can't accuse me of deceptive gentleness. The first thing she saw me do upon leaving the manor was hang her little dog; and when she asked me to do it, my first words were a wish to hang up everything that belonged to her, except one thing: perhaps she reserved that exception for herself."
"But no insolence disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration for it, if only her dear person were safe! Was it not the height of nonsense, of positive idiocy, that this servile, vile creature could even dream that I could love her? Tell your master, Nelly, that in all my life I have never met such a contemptible creature as herself. She even brings the name of Linton into disrepute; and I have, through lack of ingenuity, departed from my experiments on what she could bear, and yet shrank shamelessly! But tell her also, to reassure her brotherly and masterly heart: I keep strictly within the bounds of the law. Hitherto, I have avoided giving her the slightest right to demand a divorce; and besides, she would thank no one to separate us."
"If she wanted to leave, she could: the discomfort of his presence outweighed the satisfaction of tormenting her! ""Mr. Heathcliff,"" I said, ""that is the talk of a madman; your wife is most likely convinced you are mad, and has therefore tolerated you until now; but now that you allow her to leave, she will undoubtedly take advantage of the permission. Are you not so bewitched that you wish to remain with him of your own free will?"" ""Beware, Ellen!"" retorted Isabella, her eyes furious; her expression leaving no doubt the success of her partner's self-loathing. ""Don't believe a word he says. He is a lying devil! A monster, not a man! I have been told before that I may leave him; I have tried, but I dare not repeat it!"" But Ellen, promise me that you will not utter a word of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine."
"Whatever he says, he means to drive Edgar to despair: he claims he married me on purpose to have power over him; and he won't allow that—I die first! I only hope, I pray, that he will forget his devilish cleverness and kill me! The only pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!—Well, that will do for the present! said Heathcliff. When you are brought to trial, you will recognize his language, Nelly! And look at that face: it is almost as it would suit me. No, you are not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, and I, as your legal guardian, must keep you in my charge, however disagreeable the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean privately."
"This is no way: upstairs, I tell you! This way, my child! He seized her and pushed her out of the room. And when he came back, he murmured: ""I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I want to tear their entrails out! It is a childish moral disease; and I grind my teeth more and more violently, the greater the pain."" ""Do you understand what the word pity means?"" I asked, hastily putting my hat back on. ""Have you ever felt pity in your life?"" ""Put that down!"" he interrupted, perceiving my intention of going. ""You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must persuade or compel you to help me keep my resolution to see Catherine, and forthwith."" I swear I mean no harm: I do not wish to disturb, annoy, or offend Mr. Linton; I just want to know how she's doing and why she's sick. And I want to ask him if there's anything I can do for her."
"Last night I spent six hours in the Grange Garden, and I will return there tonight. I will remain there every night and every day until I find an opportunity to enter. Should Edgar Linton encounter me, I will kill him without hesitation and give him enough to ensure his peace during my stay. Should his servants oppose me, I will threaten them with these pistols."
"But wouldn't it be better to keep myself away from contact with them or their master? And that would be quite simple. I would warn you upon my arrival, you would discreetly admit me as soon as she was alone, and you would keep watch with a clear conscience until my departure: you would avoid any disorder. I protested against this treacherous role in my employer's house; moreover, I emphasized the cruelty and selfishness of him who disturbed Mrs. Linton's repose for his own amusement. ""The most commonplace occurrences frighten her,"" I said. ""She is nervous, and I am sure she would not bear the surprise. Do not insist, sir! Otherwise, I shall be obliged to inform my master of your intentions; and he will take measures to protect his house and its inhabitants from such intruders!"" ""In that case, I will take measures to protect you, woman!"" cried Heathcliff. ""You must not leave Wuthering Heights until tomorrow morning."""
"It's an illusion to pretend Catherine can't bear to see me. And as for surprising her, I don't want to surprise her either: You have to prepare her and ask her if I can come. You say she never mentions my name, and no one ever speaks to her about me. Who is she supposed to talk to if I'm a taboo subject in the house? She thinks you're all spies working for her husband."
"Oh, I don't doubt she's in hell with you! I think it's her silence that most troubles her. You say she's often restless and seems anxious: is that a proof of her tranquility? You speak of her disturbed mind. How could it be otherwise in her dreadful isolation? And this weak, insignificant creature, whom she supports out of DUTY and HUMANITY! Out of COMPASSION and CHARITY! One might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and hope it thrives, as imagine one could revive it from the soil of one's shallow cares? Let me say it at once: will you stay here while I make my way to Catherine about Linton and his servant? Or will you remain my friend as you have been, and do what I ask? Choose! Because there's no reason for me to stay any longer if you persist in your stubborn malice! Well, Mr. Lockwood, I protested, I complained, and I flatly refused fifty times, but finally he forced me to make a deal."
"I promised to deliver a letter from him to my mistress. If she would agree, I promised to inform her of Linton's impending absence as soon as he could come, and to return home as soon as possible. I would be out of reach, and my colleagues would be equally unavailable. Was this right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I had averted another crisis by my indulgence; and I also thought it might favorably influence Catherine's madness. Then I remembered Mr. Edgar's severe rebukes regarding my stories; and I endeavored to dispel any misgivings on the matter by repeatedly emphasizing that this breach of confidence, if it deserved so severe a term, would be the last."
"Nevertheless, my return was even sadder than before; and I had many misgivings before I could bring myself to deliver the letter to Mrs. Linton. But here is Kenneth; I will tell him how much better you are. My story is THIRTEEN, as they say, and it will dispel the worries of tomorrow."
"""How sad!"" I thought when the good woman came down to receive the doctor. And she wasn't exactly the person I'd chosen to entertain me with. Well then! I'll get myself a remedy from Mrs. Dean's bitter herbs; and above all, I must beware of the hidden magic in Catherine Heathcliff's radiant eyes. I would fall into a strange trap if I gave in to this young woman and the daughter turned out to be a second version of her mother."
"Another week has passed, and I'm getting closer to health and spring! I listened to my neighbor's story in full at several gatherings because it freed up the housekeeper's time for more important tasks. I'll continue in her own words, albeit somewhat abbreviated. She's an excellent storyteller, and I don't think I could do better."
"That evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew as well as he did that Mr. Heathcliff was nearby; and I didn't go out, as I still had his letter in my pocket and didn't want to be threatened or bothered again. I had decided not to deliver it until my master had left, as I couldn't foresee the consequences for Catherine. Therefore, the letter didn't reach him until three days later."
"The fourth day was Sunday, and I brought it to his room after the family had gone to church. A servant had been assigned to guard the house with me, and we were accustomed to locking the doors during services; but this time it was so warm and pleasant that I opened them wide. Knowing who would be there, I told my companion, in order to keep my promise, that the housewife was very keen on oranges and that he must hurry to the village to buy some so he could pay the next day. He left, and I went upstairs."
"Mrs. Linton sat, as usual, in the open window seat, wearing a flowing white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders. Her long, thick hair, some of which she had torn out at the beginning of her illness, was now combed into natural curls at her temples and neck. Her appearance had changed, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was calm, the change seemed unearthly beautiful."
"The flash in her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy, melancholy softness; they no longer gave the impression of gazing at the objects around her: they seemed always to look further, far beyond—one might say, not of this world. The pallor of her face—her haggard look had vanished when she awoke—and the peculiar expression that sprang from her state of mind, though it painfully hinted at its causes, increased the touching interest she excited; and—to me, I know, and to all who saw her, I believe—they always refuted the more tangible signs of recovery and branded her as a person doomed to decay. Before her on the windowsill lay a book, its leaves occasionally stirred by a light breeze."
"I think Linton put it this way: She never attempted to divert herself by reading or other pursuits, and he spent hours in retaining her attention on a subject that had once given her pleasure. She was aware of his intentions and, in her better spirits, bore his attempts calmly. Only occasionally did she betray her futility by suppressing a weary sigh and finally repulsing him with a melancholy smile and kisses. Sometimes she would turn away sullenly, bury her face in her hands, or even push him away angrily; and then he carefully left her alone, for he was sure it would do no good."
"The bells of Gimmerton Chapel still rang; and the rich, sweet murmur of the stream in the valley was soothing. It was a pleasant substitute for the still-missing rustle of summer leaves, which drowned the music around the Grange when the trees were covered with leaves. At Wuthering Heights, they still rang on calm days after a good thaw or a season of sustained rain."
"And Catherine, as she listened, thought of Wuthering Heights—well, when she thought or listened at all; but she had that vague, absent look I spoke of before, which expressed that she perceived material things neither with ear nor with eye. ""Here is a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,"" I said, placing it gently in the hand that rested on her knee. ""You must read it at once, for it demands an answer. Must I break the seal?"" ""Yes,"" she answered, without taking her eyes off it. I opened it—it was very short. ""Now,"" I continued, ""read it."" She withdrew her hand and let it fall again."
"I placed it on her lap again and waited for her to look at it for a moment. But the movement was so slow that I finally continued: ""Do you want me to read it, madam? It is from Mr. Heathcliff."" She started, a memory flashed back, and she struggled to collect her thoughts. She lifted the letter and seemed to examine it; and when she came to the signature, she sighed. But I could tell she had not yet grasped the meaning, for when I tried to hear her reply, she only pointed to the name and looked at me with sad, questioning impatience. ""Well, he wants to speak to you,"" I said, assuming she needed an interpreter. ""He is in the garden now, waiting impatiently for my answer."" As I spoke, I saw a large dog lying in the sunlit grass. His ears pricked as if he were about to bark, then he preened his feathers and wagged his tail to announce the approach of someone he didn't consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton leaned forward and listened attentively."
"A minute later, a footstep sounded in the hall; the open door was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist. Perhaps he sensed that I was tempted to break my promise and therefore decided to trust in his boldness. Catherine stared with strained impatience at the entrance to her room. He didn't go directly into the right room. She beckoned to me to admit him, but he found it before I reached the door, and after a few steps, he was at her side and clasped her in his arms."
"He remained silent and held her for about five minutes. During that time, he kissed more than he had ever kissed before. But my mistress had kissed him first, and I could see that he was so afraid that he found it difficult to look her in the face! He was possessed by the same conviction as I had been from the first moment he saw her: there was no hope of recovery—she was doomed. ""Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! How can I bear this?"" was his first sentence, in a tone that did not conceal his despair. And now he stared at her so intently that I thought his gaze would bring tears to his eyes; but they burned with fear; they did not melt. ""And now?"" said Catherine, leaning back and holding his gaze with a sudden grimace: her mood was only an indication of his ever-changing moods. ""You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!"" And you both regret what you did to me, as if you deserved pity! I won't feel pity for you, not me. You killed me, and I think it still gives you pleasure."
"""How strong you are! How many years do you think you'll live after I'm dead?"" Heathcliff knelt to embrace her; he tried to get up, but she grabbed him by the hair and held him back. ""I wish I could hold you in my arms,"" she continued bitterly, ""until we die! I don't care what you've been through. I'm indifferent to your suffering. Why shouldn't you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I'm buried? In twenty years' time, will you say, 'This is Catherine Earnshaw's grave'? I loved her long ago and was sad to lose her; but that's over."""
"I have loved many other people since then: my children are dearer to me than she; and if I die, I shall not be happy to be with her: I shall be sorry to leave her! Is that what you mean, Heathcliff? Don't torture me until I am as mad as you!' he cried, tearing out his head and gnashing his teeth. 'These two presented a strange and terrifying picture to an unbiased observer. Catherine might justly think that heaven would be a land of exile for her if she did not lay aside her morals along with her mortal body."
"Her face shone with fierce vengeance, on her white cheeks, her bloodless lips, and her sparkling eyes; and she held with closed fingers a lock of hair she had grasped. Her companion, on the other hand, had, while rising with one hand, grasped her arm with the other; and his gentleness was so unsuited to the requirements of his condition that, when he released her, I saw four distinct marks on his pale skin. ""Are you possessed by a demon,"" he continued angrily, ""that you speak to me thus as you die? Do you think all these words will be engraved in my memory and persist forever after your death? You know you lie when you say I killed you; and, Catherine, you know I can forget you as well as my existence! Is it not enough for your infernal selfishness that I writhe in the torments of hell while you rest in peace?"" ""I will find no rest,"" groaned Catherine, weakened by the violent and irregular beating of her heart, which pounded visibly and audibly in her excitement. She remained silent until the crisis was over; then she continued more gently: ""I wish you no greater torment than I have, Heathcliff."""
"I only wish that we shall never be separated again. And if after this, a word from me still pains you, remember that I feel the same pain deep down, and forgive me! Come here and kneel again! You have never hurt me in your life. No, if you still harbor anger, the memory will be worse than my harsh words! Will you not come back? Do it! Heathcliff sank into his chair and leaned forward, but not far enough to see her face, which was deathly pale with emotion. She bent down to look at him; he would not allow it: he turned abruptly and went to the fireplace, where he remained silent with his back to us."
"Mrs. Linton's gaze followed him suspiciously; every movement aroused a new feeling in her. After a pause and a long look, she continued, turning to me with indignant disappointment: ""Oh, you see, Nelly, he wouldn't hesitate for a moment to rescue me from the grave. That's how I'm loved! Never mind."""
"He is not MY Heathcliff. I will always love mine and carry him within me: He is in my soul. And, she added thoughtfully, what annoys me most is this broken prison."
"I'm tired of being locked up here. I'm tired of escaping into this wonderful world, of always being in it: not to see it through tears or long for it through the walls of grief, but to truly be in it, to be in it. Nelly, you think you're better and happier than me, in the best of health and in the best of shape: you pity me, that will soon change."
"""I'll take pity on you. I'll be incomparably superior to all of you. I wonder why he doesn't want to be near me!"" she continued murmuring. ""I thought he wished."""
"Heathcliff, my dear! Don't be so sad now. Come to me, Heathcliff."" In her haste, she stood up and leaned on the arm of the chair. After this fervent prayer, he turned to her with a despairing look."
"His eyes, wide-open and moist, finally cast a fierce glance at her; his chest heaved convulsively. For an instant their eyes met, then I scarcely saw it, but suddenly Catherine sat up and seized her, and they embraced in an embrace from which my mistress, I believed, would never emerge alive; indeed, she seemed to me instantly unconscious. He threw himself onto the nearest chair, and when I hurried over to see if she had fainted, he gritted his teeth, foamed like a mad dog, and drew her to him with greedy jealousy."
"I felt uneasy in the company of a being of my own kind: he didn't seem to understand me, even though I spoke to him; so I drew back and remained silent, deeply perplexed. A movement from Catherine gave me a moment of relief: she raised her hand to take him by the neck and press her cheek against his, while he held her fast; while he, in turn, showered her with wild caresses and said in a wild voice: ""Now show me how cruel, how cruel, how deceitful you have been. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have no words to console you."""
"You deserve this. You killed yourself. Yes, you can kiss me and cry; but take my kisses and my tears away from me: they will ruin you, they will damn you."
"You loved me then, what right had you to leave me? What right, tell me, did you have to harbor this miserable fantasy for Linton? For neither misery, nor humiliation, nor death, nor anything else that God or Satan could have inflicted on us, did you do of your own free will. I did not break your heart, you broke it; and in breaking it, you broke mine. So much the worse for me, for I am strong."
"Do I want to live? What kind of life will it be if you—oh God!—want to live with your soul in the grave? CHAPTER 15 ""Leave me alone. Leave me alone,"" sobbed Catherine. ""If I have done wrong, I will die of it. That is enough! You, too, have abandoned me: but I will not reproach you! I forgive you."""
"""Forgive me!"" ""It is hard to forgive, to look into those eyes, to feel those withered hands,"" he replied. ""Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes! I forgive you for what you did to me. I love MY murderer, but yours! How could I?"" They were silent, their faces buried in tears. At least, I suspect the tears came from both sides; it seemed as if Heathcliff was crying on such an important occasion."
"By now, I was feeling rather ill; the afternoon was passing quickly, the man I had dismissed was returning from his errand, and in the light of the setting sun over the valley floor, I could make out a crowd gathered outside the porch of Gimmerton Chapel. ""Service is over,"" I announced. ""My master will be here in half an hour."" Heathcliff groaned and cursed and drew Catherine closer; she didn't move for a moment. Suddenly, I saw a group of servants coming up the street to the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was close behind me; he opened the gate himself and walked slowly upstairs, probably enjoying this beautiful afternoon with its sweet summer breeze. ""He's here!"" I cried. ""For goodness' sake, come down quickly! You won't find anyone on the main staircase."""
"""Quick, stay among the trees until he comes."" ""I must go, Cathy,"" said Heathcliff, trying to wriggle out of his companion's arms. ""But if I survive, I'll see you again before you fall asleep. I won't go five meters from your window."" ""You mustn't go!"" she answered, holding him as tightly as her strength allowed. ""You mustn't, I tell you."" ""For an hour,"" he implored her. ""Not a minute,"" she answered. ""I MUST—Linton will get up at once,"" insisted the surprised intruder. He would have risen and freed her fingers with that gesture; she clung to him, panting: fierce determination was written all over her face. ""No!"" she shrieked. ""Oh, don't go, don't go."""
"This is the last time! Edgar won't hurt us. Heathcliff, I'm dying! I'm dying! ""Good heavens, you fool! There he is!"" cried Heathcliff, sinking back in his chair. ""Shh, my darling! Shh, shh, Catherine! I'm staying. If he shot me like that, I'd die with a blessing on my lips."" And they left quickly."
"I heard my master coming up the stairs; cold sweat stood on my forehead: I was horrified. ""Do you want to listen to her babble?"" I asked passionately. ""She doesn't know what she's saying. Do you want to ruin her just because she isn't intelligent enough to defend herself? Stand up! You could be free immediately. This is the most diabolical act you have ever committed."""
"""We are all ready: master, mistress, and servant."" CHAPTER XV I wrung my hands and shouted; and Mr. Linton quickened his pace at the noise. In the midst of my excitement, I was sincerely glad to see Catherine's arms slacken and her head hang down. ""She is either weak or dead,"" I thought, ""so much the better. Better dead than to become a burden and source of misery to all around her."" Edgar rushed upon his unexpected guest, pale with surprise and anger."
"What he intended, I don't know; but the other immediately put an end to all the demonstrations by taking the lifeless figure in his arms. ""Look!"" he said. ""If you are not a demon, help her first, then you will speak to me!"" He went into the living room and sat down. Mr. Linton called me, and with much effort and trial, we succeeded in bringing her to her senses; but she was completely bewildered; she sighed and groaned and recognized no one. Edgar, in his concern for her, forgot his hated friend."
"I didn't. I went there as quickly as possible and begged him to leave. I assured him that Catherine was feeling better and that he would hear from me in the morning about his night. ""I won't refuse to go out,"" he replied, ""but I'll stay in the garden. And Nelly, keep your word tomorrow. I'll be under those larches."""
"""Look! Or I'll return, whether Linton is here or not."" He cast a quick glance through the half-open chamber door, and, after assuring himself that what I had just said was evidently true, left the house of his unfortunate presence. About midnight that night, the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights was born: a little baby of seven months; two hours after her mother's death, without having sufficiently recovered consciousness to miss Heathcliff or recognize Edgar. The latter's bewilderment at his loss is too painful a subject to enlarge upon; the aftermath showed how deeply grief had overwhelmed him."
"A great advantage, in my eyes, was that he had no heir. I felt sorry for him as I looked at the frail orphan and inwardly cursed old Linton for (out of pure partiality) leaving his fortune to his daughter instead of his son. He was an unwanted baby, poor thing! He could have lost his life, and no one cared about it in those first hours of his life."
"We made up for this omission later; but the beginning was as hostile as the end was likely to be. The next morning, it was fine and bright outside, and a soft light filtered through the blinds of the quiet room, bathing the sofa and the person sitting on it in a soft, delicate glow. Edgar Linton had laid his head on the pillow and closed his eyes."
"Her young, beautiful features seemed almost as lifeless as those of the person beside him; yet HE was the stillness of exhausted fear and HIS perfect peace. Her smooth brow, her closed eyelids, her lips expressing a smile—no angel in heaven could have been more beautiful than she appeared. And I shared the infinite silence in which she rested: never was my spirit holier than when contemplating this carefree image of divine repose."
"Instinctively, I repeated the words she had spoken a few hours before: ""Incomparably above us all! Whether she be on earth or in heaven, her spirit is at peace with God!"" I don't know if it's a trait of mine, but I am seldom anything but happy when I stand watch in the death chamber, when no mourner, despairing or despairing, shares that duty with me. I see there a peace that neither earth nor hell can break, and feel the certainty of an endless and shadowless beyond—the eternity they have entered—where life is boundless, love compassionate, and joy in its fullness. I remarked then how much selfishness there is even in a love such as Mr. Linton's, when he so lamented Catherine's blessed release! After her capricious and impatient life, one might have doubted whether she had finally deserved an oasis of repose."
"In moments of serene contemplation, one might have doubts, but not in the presence of his body. He radiated a calm that seemed to promise the same peace as his former inhabitant. Do you think such people are happy in the afterlife, sir? I would give anything to know."
"I declined to answer Mrs. Dean's question, as it seemed rather unorthodox to me. She continued, ""I fear we have no right to believe she is following in the footsteps of Catherine Linton; but we leave her to her Creator."" The Lord seemed to be asleep, and shortly after sunrise I ventured out of the room into the pure, refreshing air."
"The servants thought I had come to shake off the fatigue of my long night's vigil; in reality, my main motive was to see Mr. Heathcliff. Had he remained under the larches all night, he would not have heard the commotion in the Grange, unless he had seen the messenger galloping to Gimmerton. Had he come closer, he would probably have noticed from the flickering lights and the sound of the outer doors opening and closing that all was not well within."
"I was burning to find him, but also afraid. I felt the terrible news had to be delivered to me, and I could hardly wait to process it. But how, I didn't know. He was there, at least a few meters away, in the park. He was leaning against an old ash tree, his hat off, his hair wet with the dew that had collected on the budding branches and crackled around him."
"He had been there for quite a while, because I saw a couple of donkeys flying barely a meter away, busy building their nests, paying no more attention to their proximity than to a piece of wood. As I approached, they flew away, and he opened his eyes and said, ""She's dead!"" he said. ""I didn't wait for you to know. Put your handkerchief away and don't cry in front of me."""
"Good heavens! She won't give you any tears! I wept as much for him as for her: sometimes one feels sorry for creatures who have no compassion for themselves or others. When I first looked into his face, I saw that he had heard of the catastrophe; and the wild thought came to me that his heart was softened and he was praying, for his lips were moving and his eyes were fixed on the ground. ""Yes, she is dead!"" I answered, stifling my sobs and wiping my cheeks. ""Gone to Heaven, I hope; where we may all go to her if we heed the necessary warnings and give up our wicked ways to follow what is right!"" ""Did SHE heed the necessary warnings?"" asked Heathcliff, attempting a mocking look. ""Did she die a saint? Come, tell me the truth of the event. What—?"" He tried to pronounce the name, but could not; And he pressed his lips together, silently fighting his inner pain, while defying my pity with a grim and fearless look. ""How did she die?"" he finally asked, despite his boldness, eager for support; for after this struggle, in spite of everything, he trembled to his fingertips. ""Poor fellow!"" I thought. ""You have the same heart and nerves as your fellow men! Why should you hide them? Your pride cannot blind God! You tempt him to wrest them from you until he utters a cry of humiliation."" ""Silent as a lamb!"" I answered aloud. ""She sighed and stretched like a child waking and falling asleep again; and five minutes later I felt a slight throbbing in her heart, and nothing more!"" ""And... did she ever speak of me?"" he asked hesitantly, as if afraid the answer might reveal details he could not bear to reveal. ""She never regained her senses. Since you left her, she hasn't recognized anyone,"" I said. ""She lies there with a sweet smile, and her last thoughts are of her beautiful childhood years."""
"Her life ended in a sweet dream—may she wake as sweetly in the hereafter!—May she wake in agony! he cried with horrible violence, stamping his feet and groaning in a sudden fit of uncontrollable passion. “Well, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not THERE—not in Heaven, not in dying—where? Oh! You said you didn’t care about my suffering! And I say a prayer—I repeat it until my tongue is stiff: Catherine Earnshaw, may you have no rest while I live; you said I murdered you—so haunt me! The murdered haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that spirits have walked the earth. Be with me always—assume any shape—drive me mad!” Only don’t leave me in that abyss where I cannot find you! Oh, my God! It is unspeakable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!’ He beat his head against the gnarled trunk, looked up, and howled, not like a human being, but like a wild animal being hunted to death with knives and spears."
"I saw several bloodstains on the tree bark, as well as on his hand and forehead. The scene I witnessed was probably a repeat of those that had unfolded during the night. It barely affected me; it astonished me. Still, I hesitated to leave him like that. But as soon as he recovered enough to notice my observation, he barked the order to depart, and I obeyed."
"It was impossible for me to console or reassure him! Mrs. Linton's funeral was to take place on the Friday following her death; and until then, her coffin lay uncovered, strewn with flowers and fragrant leaves, in the great drawing-room. Linton spent his days and nights there like a sleepless watchdog; and—what I revealed only to myself—Heathcliff at least spent his nights outside and, likewise, had no desire for rest. I had no contact with him, but knew of his intention of coming in when he could; and on Tuesday, shortly after sunset, when my master, from fatigue, had to go home for a few hours, I went and opened a window, as he insisted on giving him the opportunity to bid a last farewell to the faded image of his idol."
"He didn't miss the opportunity, cautious and brief; too cautious to betray his presence at the slightest noise. In fact, I wouldn't have noticed him if the curtain around the corpse's face hadn't hung askew and I hadn't seen a lock of pale hair on the floor, tied with a silver thread. On closer inspection, it turned out to be from a locket that hung around Catherine's neck. Heathcliff had opened the locket, emptied its contents, and replaced it with a black lock of his own."
"I confused the two. Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to bury his sister's remains. He didn't apologize, but he never came. Therefore, apart from her husband, the audience consisted entirely of tenants and servants. Isabella wasn't invited."
"To the villagers' surprise, Catherine's grave was neither in the chapel beneath the carved Linton monument nor near the graves of her relatives outside. The grave was dug on a grassy slope in a corner of the cemetery, where the wall is so low that heather and bilberries have overgrown it; sphagnum moss covers it almost completely. Her husband now lies in the same spot; both have a simple headstone above them and a plain gray block at their feet to mark their graves."
"This Friday was our last nice day in a month. In the evening, the weather changed: the wind shifted from south to northeast, bringing rain, then sleet and snow. The next day, it was hard to believe that summer had already lasted three weeks: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under winter snowdrifts; the larks were silent, and the young leaves of the first trees were blackened by the fire."
"And that morning dawned dark, cold, and gloomy! My master kept his room; I took possession of the solitary parlor and converted it into a nursery. I was sitting there with a whimpering doll on my lap, rocking it back and forth, and watching the flakes still fly through the curtainless window, when the door opened and someone came in, gasping and laughing! My anger was for a moment greater than my surprise. I thought it was one of the maids and cried, ""Ready! How dare you show your thoughtlessness here? What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?"" ""Excuse me!"" answered a familiar voice; ""but I know Edgar is in bed, and there's nothing I can do about it."" Then the speaker came panting towards me with her hand at her side. ""I ran all the way from Wuthering Heights!"" she continued after a pause; ""except where I flew."" I couldn't count how many times I fell."
"Oh, I hurt all over! Don't panic! I'll explain as soon as possible. Just go downstairs, order the carriage to Gimmerton, and ask a servant to fetch some clothes from my wardrobe. The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She didn't look at all like she was having a fit of laughter: her hair was flowing over her shoulders from snow and water; she was wearing her usual girl's dress, which was more in keeping with her age than her condition: a low-cut, short-sleeved gown with no head or neck. The dress was made of light silk and clung to her body when wet, and her feet were protected only by thin slippers. Added to this was a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold kept from bleeding profusely, a pale face covered with scratches and bruises, and a body that could barely stand from exhaustion. You can imagine that my initial shock didn't subside much once I had time to examine her. ""My dear young lady,"" I cried, ""I'm not going anywhere and I won't hear from you until you've taken off all your clothes and put on dry ones. And you certainly won't be going to Gimmerton tonight, so there's no point in ordering a carriage."" ""I certainly will,"" she said, ""on foot or on horseback; but I don't mind dressing decently."""
"And—ah, look how it's running down my throat now! The fire really hurts me.” She insisted on following her instructions before allowing me to touch her; and only after the coachman had dressed and a maid had packed the necessary clothes did I receive her permission to dress the wound and help her change. “Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was completed and she was sitting in an armchair by the fire with a cup of tea before her, “sit opposite me and dress Catherine's baby: I don't like to see it! You mustn't think I care for Catherine just because I was foolish enough to come in: I wept bitterly too—yes, more than anyone has cause to weep. We parted irreconcilably, you remember, and I won't forgive myself.” But still, I had no pity for him—that beast! Oh, give me the poker! It's all I have left of him!” She took the gold ring off her ring finger and threw it on the ground. ""I'm going to break it!"" she continued, hitting it with childish malice, ""and then I'm going to burn it!"" And she picked up the abused object and threw it into the embers. ""Look! He'll definitely buy me a new one when he gets me back."""
"He might come for me and annoy Edgar. I dare not stay for fear the thought might put him into his evil head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind to me, has he? And I did not come to ask his help; and I shall not give him any more trouble. I had to seek refuge here; but if I had not known that he was avoiding me, I would have gone into the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, if you had brought me what I needed, and returned to a place beyond the reach of my accursed—that very goblin! Oh, he was so angry! If he had caught me! It is a pity that Earnshaw is no match for him in strength: I would not have run away until I had seen him almost destroyed, if Hindley could have done it! ""Come now, don't talk so fast, miss!"" I interrupted. “Otherwise you’ll tangle the handkerchief I tied around your face, and the wound will start bleeding again.”"
"Drink your tea, take a deep breath, and forget laughing: laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition! ""Undeniable truth!"" she replied. ""Listen to the child! It cries incessantly; keep it away from me for an hour; I won't stay any longer."" I rang the bell and entrusted it to a servant; then I asked her why she had fled Wuthering Heights in this unlikely situation and where she intended to go, since she refused to stay with us. ""I had to stay, and I really wanted to stay,"" she replied, ""to cheer Edgar up and look after the baby, for two reasons, and because the Grange is my rightful home. But I tell you, he wouldn't let me! Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and cheerful? Bear to see us quiet and not anxious to poison our comforts?"" Now I have the satisfaction of knowing for certain that he hates me, so much so that it annoys him deeply to have me within earshot or sight. I notice that whenever I approach him, his face involuntarily twists into an expression of hatred; partly because he knows I have good reasons for it, partly from a primal dislike. This hatred is strong enough to convince me that he would not pursue me across England, provided I found a safe exit; so I must run away."
"I've overcome my initial desire to be killed by him: I would have preferred him to kill himself! He has indeed destroyed my love, and that reassures me. I still remember how much I loved him; and I vaguely imagine that perhaps I would still love him if... no, no! Even if he had loved me, his diabolical nature would have revealed itself one way or another. Catherine had terribly perverse tastes to value him so highly because she knew him so well."
"Monstrous! I wish he were erased from creation and from my memory! ""Shh! He's a man,"" I said. ""Be a little gentler: there are worse men than he!"" ""He's not a man,"" she replied, ""and he has no claim to my mercy. I gave him my heart, and he took it, crushed it, and threw it back to me. One feels for the heart, Ellen, and since he destroyed mine, I can feel no pity for him. And I wouldn't, even if he moaned and wept tears of blood for Catherine until his death! No, truly, truly, I wouldn't!"" And here Isabella began to weep; but she immediately wiped the water from her eyelashes and began again. ""You asked me what finally made me run away?"" I felt compelled to try, for I had succeeded in inflaming his anger more strongly than his malice."
"Tearing nerves with red-hot tongs requires more self-control than hitting someone on the head. He was so angry that he forgot the devilish cleverness he boasted about and resorted to murderous violence. I took pleasure in annoying him: this pleasure aroused my instinct for self-preservation, so I freed myself; and should I ever fall into his hands again, he is entitled to terrible revenge. ""Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been present at the funeral."""
"He remained sober, indeed, perfectly sober: he did not go to bed drunk at six o'clock, nor rise drunk at midnight. He therefore rose in a suicidal and sullen mood, as if ready to go to church or to a dance; instead, he sat by the fire and drank glasses of gin or brandy. ""Heathcliff! The name makes me shudder!"" was a stranger in the house from last Sunday until today. Whether it was the angels who fed him, or his family with them, I do not know; but he has not eaten with us for nearly a week."
"He came home just at sunrise and went up to his room, where he contemplated himself—as if someone were dreaming of desiring his company! There he continued to pray like a Methodist: only the deity he invoked was nothing more than insignificant dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was strangely taken for his own black father! After he had finished these precious prayers—and they usually lasted until he grew hoarse and his voice caught in his throat—he set out again, always straight to the Grange! I wonder if Edgar hadn't sent a policeman to arrest him! Much as I mourned for Catherine, it was impossible for me not to consider this time of freedom from humiliating oppression a holiday. I gathered enough courage to endure Joseph's endless sermons without tears and to walk about the house less often with the feet of a terrified thief. You wouldn't think I burst into tears at the slightest word Joseph utters; but he and Hareton are disgusting company. I'd rather sit with Hindley and listen to his dreadful prattle than with 'the little master' and his faithful follower, that dreadful old man! When Heathcliff is at home, I often have to take refuge in the kitchen and its company, or starve in the damp, uninhabited rooms; when he is not there, as has been the case this week, I put a table and chair in a corner by the fire, without taking the trouble to look for Mr. Earnshaw; and he never disturbs my engagements."
"He is calmer now than before, unless provoked: gloomy and more depressed and less angry. Joseph confirms that he is certain he has changed: the Lord has touched his heart, and he has been saved ""as through fire."" I am surprised to see signs of positive change, but that is not my concern. ""Last night I sat in my corner late into the night reading old books. The walk upstairs was so sad while the snow swirled outside, and my thoughts kept returning to the cemetery and the freshly dug grave! I hardly dared to take my eyes off the page; that melancholy scene immediately took its place."""
"Hindley sat opposite him, his head in his hand, perhaps thinking the same thing. He had stopped drinking when it had become almost irrational and hadn't moved or spoken for two or three hours. Not a sound could be heard in the house except the howling of the wind occasionally rattling the windows, the faint crackle of the embers, and the click of my candle scissors as I occasionally pulled the long wick from the candle."
"Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad. As I read, I sighed, for it seemed to me that all joy had vanished from the world and would never return. The gloomy silence was finally broken by the sound of the kitchen door opening: Heathcliff had returned home from his watch earlier than usual, probably because of the sudden thunderstorm. That entrance was barred, and we heard him enter through the other."
"I rose with the irresistible expression of what I felt on my lips, whereupon my companion, who had been staring at the door, turned to me. ""I'll detain him for five minutes,"" he cried. ""Do you mind?"" ""No, you can detain him all night,"" I replied. ""Do it! Put the key in the door and draw the bolts."" Earnshaw obeyed before his guest reached the entrance; then he came over, placed his chair on the other side of my table, leaned over it, and searched my eyes for a trace of sympathy for the burning hatred that emanated from him. Looking and feeling like a murderer, he did not quite find it; but he did find enough to encourage him to speak. ""You and I,"" he said, ""are both in this man's debt!"" If we were not cowards, we could pay together. Are you as weak as your brother? Are you willing to endure to the end without doing anything for it?' 'I am tired of suffering,' I replied, 'and would be glad of a revenge that does not rebound upon me; but treason and violence are double-ended spears; they wound those who seize them more than their enemies.' 'Treason and violence are a just revenge for treason and violence!' cried Hindley. 'Mrs. Heathcliff, I beg you to do nothing but be still and quiet. Tell me now, can you tell me? I am sure you would be as glad as I am to witness the end of the Devil's existence; he will cause your death if you do not defeat him, and he will cause MY ruin.'"
"Cursed be that devilish villain! He's knocking on the door as if he were already in charge! Promise me you'll be quiet, and before the clock strikes—which will be in three minutes—you'll be a free woman! He took the tool I described in my letter from his chest and was about to extinguish the candle. But I snatched it from his hand and grabbed his arm. ""I won't be silent!"" I said. ""You mustn't touch it. Close the door and be quiet!"" ""No! I've made my decision, and by God, I'll carry it out!"" cried the desperate creature. ""I'll do you a favor after all and bring justice for Hareton! And you needn't worry about my protection; Catherine is dead."""
"No one would regret or be ashamed of me, even if I had slit my throat—and it's time to put an end to that! I might as well have been fighting a bear or talking to a madman. I had no choice but to rush to a gate and warn the victim of the fate that awaited them. ""Better seek refuge elsewhere tonight!"" I cried triumphantly. ""Mr. Earnshaw intends to shoot you if you continue to try to break in."" ""You'd better open the door, you—"" he retorted with an elegant formula that I'd rather not repeat. ""I'm not interfering,"" I replied. ""Go in and be shot if you want. I've done my duty."" With that, I closed the window and returned to my place by the fire, too little hypocrisy to show the slightest concern at the impending danger."
"Earnshaw scolded me passionately: he protested that I had always loved the villain, and reproved me for my base disposition. And deep in my heart (and my conscience never reproached me) I thought what a blessing it would be to him if Heathcliff would relieve him of his sufferings; and what a blessing to me if he would send him home! While I was pondering these thoughts, the window behind me burst beneath the villain's blow, and his black face gleamed through with devastating force. The jambs were too close for his shoulders to follow them, and I smiled, pleased with my imagined safety."
"His hair and clothes were snow-white, and his sharp, cannibalistic teeth, revealing cold and rage, gleamed in the darkness. ""Isabella, let me in, or I'll change your mind!"" he grinned, as Joseph says. ""I can't commit murder,"" I replied. ""Mr. Hindley is standing guard with a knife and a loaded pistol."" ""Take me in through the kitchen door,"" he said. ""Hindley will be there for me,"" I replied, ""and what a poor darling, that yours can't stand a blizzard! We used to stay in bed alone while the summer moon shone, but as soon as a winter storm returns, we must run for cover! Heathcliff, if I were you, I would lie down on his grave and die like a faithful dog. Isn't the world worth living in now?"" You've made it clear to me that Catherine was the only joy in your life: I can't imagine how you intend to cope with her loss."" ""He's here, isn't he?"" my companion shouted, running toward the opening. ""If I can get my arm out, I can beat him!"" ""I'm afraid, Ellen, you're portraying me as a truly bad person; but you don't know everything, so don't judge me. For nothing in the world would I have supported or encouraged an attempt on his life."""
"I wished him dead, I had to. And I was deeply disappointed and dismayed by the consequences of my mockery when he lunged at Earnshaw's weapon and snatched it from his hand. The charge exploded, and the knife sank into its owner's wrist. Heathcliff yanked it out violently, slicing the flesh, and stuffed it dripping wet into his pocket. Then he grabbed a stone, broke through the partition between two windows, and jumped in."
"His opponent had lost consciousness due to unbearable pain and the blood gushing from a major artery or vein. The villain kicked and punched him, banged his head against the floorboards several times, and held me with one hand to prevent me from calling Joseph. He performed an act of superhuman self-sacrifice by not completely finishing him off; but gasping, he finally stopped and dragged the seemingly lifeless body onto the bench."
"There, he tore Earnshaw's coat sleeve and bandaged the wound with brutal force. He spat and cursed, kicking as hard as he did. Free again, I hurried to fetch the old servant. He was beginning to understand what I had hastily said and rushed down the stairs, panting, two at a time. ""What shall we do now? What shall we do now?"" ""So,"" thundered Heathcliff, ""your master is mad; and if he lives another month, I'll send him to an asylum. And how on earth did you lock me up, you toothless dog? Don't stand there muttering all the time."""
"Come on, I won't take care of him. Wash that thing for me and watch the sparks from your candle! It's more than half brandy! ""And then you mutter about him!"" cried Joseph, throwing his hands and eyes up in horror. ""If I ever see such a thing! May the Lord—"" Heathcliff gently pushed him to his knees in the middle of the blood and threw him a napkin. But instead of wiping it away, he clasped his hands and began a prayer whose strange wording made me laugh. I was in a state where nothing surprised me anymore: I was even as careless as some criminals at the foot of the gallows. ""Oh, I have forgotten you,"" said the tyrant. ""You will forget him."""
"""Done! And you're conspiring with him against me, Viper? Listen, that's your job!"" He shook me until my teeth chattered and sat me down next to Joseph, who finished his pleas vigorously, then stood up and swore to leave for the estate immediately. Mr. Linton was a justice of the peace, and despite his fifty lost wives, he would continue to investigate."
"He persisted so persistently that Heathcliff deemed it advisable to extract a summary of what had happened from me. Trembling with malice, he stood over me while I reluctantly gave him the account in answer to his questions. It took the old man great effort to convince him that Heathcliff was not the aggressor, especially in light of my succinct answers. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was still alive. Joseph hastened to administer a dose of strong liquor, and his master soon regained consciousness."
"Heathcliff, knowing that his antagonist was ignorant of the treatment he had received while unconscious, called him a mad drunkard and advised him to dwell no further on his abominable behavior, but to go to bed. To my great joy, after this wise advice, he left us, and Hindley stretched himself out on the mantelpiece. I returned to my room, surprised at how easily I had escaped. ""This morning, as I went downstairs about midnight, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting gravely ill by the fire; his evil ghost, almost as thin and hideous, was leaning against the mantelpiece."
"None of us seemed in the mood for dinner, and after waiting until everything on the table had cooled, I began to eat alone. Nothing prevented me from eating heartily, and I felt a certain satisfaction and superiority in glancing occasionally at my silent companions and feeling the comforting sense of a clear conscience. After I had finished, I took the unusual liberty of stepping close to the fire, walking around Earnshaw's chair, and kneeling beside him in a corner. Heathcliff did not look at me, and I looked up and observed his face with almost as much certainty as if it were petrified."
"His brow, which I had once considered so manly and which now seemed so diabolical, was obscured by a heavy cloud; his bastard eyes were almost extinguished by sleeplessness and perhaps also by tears, for his eyelashes were moist; his lips, deprived of their fierce smile, were covered with an expression of unspeakable sorrow. Had it happened at any other time, I would have hidden my face from such grief. In his case, I felt flattered; and however unworthy it might seem to insult a fallen enemy, I could not pass up this opportunity to shoot an arrow: his weakness was the only moment in which I could savor the joy of returning wrong with wrong. ""Fie, fie, miss!"" I interrupted. ""One would think you had never opened a Bible in your life."""
"If God torments your enemies, that should be enough. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torments to his! ""In general, I admit it, Ellen,"" she continued; ""but what suffering could Heathcliff alleviate for me if I had nothing to do with it? I would rather he suffer less if I could cause his suffering and he KNOW that I am the cause. Oh, I owe him so much."""
"I can only forgive him on one condition: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every stab, a blow back; to bring him down to my level. Since he hurt him first, he should ask for forgiveness first; and then... well, Ellen, perhaps I could show you a little generosity."
"But I absolutely cannot take revenge, and therefore cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted water, so I gave him a glass and asked how he was. ""Not as sick as I'd like,"" he replied. ""But if I don't take my arm away, every inch of my body aches as if I'd been fighting a legion of demons!"" ""Yes, no wonder,"" I then replied. ""Catherine always boasted that she would stick by you and not hurt you physically: she said that some people wouldn't hurt you for fear of offending her. It's a good thing people don't REALLY come back to life, or she would have been a terrible sight last night! Don't you have bruises and cuts on your chest and shoulders?"" ""I can't say,"" he replied, ""but what do you think? Did he dare hit me when I was already on the ground?"" ""He stamped on you, kicked you, and threw you to the ground,"" I muttered. ""And his mouth watered as he tore you with his teeth; for he is only half a man: not so much, and the rest is a devil."" Mr. Earnshaw, like me, gazed into the face of our common enemy; this one, sunk in anguish, seemed insensible to everything around him: the more still he lay, the more clearly his reflections revealed their blackness through his features. ""Oh, if God gave me the strength to strangle him in my agony, I would go to hell for joy,"" moaned the impatient man, writhing to rise and sinking down in despair, convinced of his inability to resist. ""No, it is enough that he has murdered one of you,"" I remarked aloud. ""Everyone at the Grange knows that your sister would still be alive if it had not been for Mr. Heathcliff."
"After all, it is better to be hated than loved. When I think back to our happiness—Catherine's happiness before her birth—I could curse this day. Heathcliff probably recognized the truth of what was said better than the speaker's mind. His attention was aroused, I could see, for his eyes shed tears into the ashes, and he breathed chokingly."
"I looked him straight in the eyes and laughed contemptuously. For a moment, the misty lights of hell shone back at me; but the devil, who usually kept watch, was so dim and drowned that I was not afraid of hearing another mocking sound. ""Stand up and get out of my sight,"" said the mourner. ""At least, I suspected he had said those words, though his voice was barely audible."" ""Excuse me,"" I replied. ""But I loved Catherine too; and her brother needs care, and for her sake, I will provide it. Now that she is dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has nothing but her eyes, if you hadn't tried to gouge them out and dye them black and red; and she—"" ""Stand up, you poor fool, before I trample you to death!"" he cried, making a gesture that made me do the same. ""Well,"" I continued, preparing to run away, ""if poor Catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, and degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have painted a similar picture! She would not have borne your vile behavior in peace: her horror and disgust must have made themselves felt."" ""The back of the sofa and Earnshaw stood between him and me. Instead of trying to reach me, he snatched a dinner knife from the table and threw it at my head."""
"She struck me under the ear, interrupting the sentence I was about to utter; but I held it back, rushed to the door, and hurled another, hoping it would fly a little farther than her missile. The last I saw of her was a furious attack, averted by the embrace of her host; and both fell huddled on the hearth. Fleeing through the kitchen, I bade Joseph hasten to his master; I overturned Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies over the back of the chair in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I leaped, leaped, and dashed down the steep street; then, leaving the winding roads, I shot across the moor, rolled over the banks, and waded through the marshes: I did fall upon the landmark of the Grange."
"And I would much rather be condemned to eternal hell than linger for even a single night under the roof of Wuthering Heights again. Isabella paused and took a sip of tea; then she stood up and ordered me to put on my hat and a large shawl I had brought with me. Ignoring my entreaties for an hour, she climbed onto a chair, kissed the portraits of Edgar and Catherine, bowed to me in the same way, and climbed into the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who shouted with joy at seeing her mistress again. She was taken away and was never to set foot in these parts again; but once things had calmed down, a regular correspondence developed between her and my master. I believe her new home was in the south, near London; a son was born there a few months after her escape."
"He was christened Linton, and from the beginning she called him a sickly, gloomy creature. Mr. Heathcliff, whom I met one day in the village, asked me where she lived. I refused to tell him."
"He pointed out that this wasn't a problem, but she should be careful not to go to her brother's: she couldn't be with him if he had to take care of her himself. Although I didn't give him any information, he learned of her whereabouts and the child's existence from other servants. Nevertheless, he didn't bother her: a patience she probably owed to his dislike."
"He often asked me about the baby when he saw me; and when he heard its name, he would smile gloomily and say, ""They want me to hate it too, don't they?"" ""I don't think they want you to know anything,"" I replied. ""But I shall have it,"" he said, ""whenever I need it. They can depend on it!"" Fortunately, his mother died before then, some thirteen years after Catherine's death, when Linton was twelve or a little older. The day after Isabella's unexpected visit, I had no opportunity to speak to my master; he avoided all conversation and was not inclined to any discussion."
"When I made him listen to me, I saw that he took pleasure in his sister's abandonment; he hated it with an intensity his gentle nature seemed hardly able to bear. His disgust was so deep and sensitive that he avoided going anywhere where he could see or hear Heathcliff. Grief and all this combined made him a complete recluse: he gave up his magistrate's office, stopped even going to church, avoided the village at all costs, and lived a life of complete seclusion within the confines of his park and estate, broken only by solitary walks on the moor and visits to his wife's grave, usually in the evening or early morning, before the other tramps came out."
But he was too good to be truly unhappy for long. He didn't pray that Catherine's soul would torment him. Time brought him resignation and a melancholy sweeter than ordinary joy.
"He remembered her with deep, tender love and longed for a better world, to which he had undoubtedly passed. And he also felt earthly comfort and affection. For a few days, I say, the insignificant successor of the deceased seemed indifferent to him: the cold melted as quickly as snow in April, and before the little creature could stammer a word or take a step, she wielded the scepter of a despot in his heart."
"Her name was Catherine; but he never called her by her full name, just as he had never called the first Catherine by her shortened form: probably because Heathcliff was used to that name. The little girl was always called Cathy: for him, this marked a distinction from his mother, but also a connection to her; and his affection stemmed much more from this relationship with her than from the fact that she was his own daughter. I often compared him to Hindley Earnshaw and couldn't really explain why her behavior in similar situations was so contradictory."
"They had both been beloved husbands and had cared lovingly for their children. I couldn't imagine that they couldn't have followed the same path, for better or for worse. Yet, I thought, Hindley, seemingly the stronger of the two, had unfortunately proven himself the worse and weaker. When his ship ran aground, the captain abandoned his post. And instead of trying to save him, the crew descended into rebellion and confusion, leaving no hope for their ill-fated vessel."
"Linton, on the other hand, demonstrated the true courage of a faithful and believing soul: he trusted in God, and God comforted him. One hoped, the other despaired: they had chosen their fate and were justly condemned to suffer it. But you will not hear my moral teachings, Mr. Lockwood; you will judge all these things as best as I can. At least you will believe it, and it is the same thing."
"Earnshaw's death was as expected; it followed his sister's barely six months later. At the Grange, we never received a brief account of his condition; I learned only that he would be assisting with the funeral arrangements. Mr. Kenneth came to inform my master of the event. ""Well, Nelly,"" he said, coming into the garden one morning, too early not to immediately startle me with an uneasy feeling, ""now it's your and my turn to take over the mourning."""
"""Who do you think has caught us now?"" ""Who?"" I asked excitedly. ""Guess!"" he replied, dismounting and hanging his bridle on a hook by the door. ""And pinch your apron. You'll certainly need it."" ""It's not Mr. Heathcliff, is it?"" I exclaimed. ""What? You'd mourn him?"" said the doctor. ""No, Heathcliff is a strong young man. He's beaming today. I've just seen him. He's gained weight rapidly since losing his better half."" ""Who is it, Mr. Kenneth?"" I repeated impatiently. ""Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,"" he replied, ""and my gossips. Although he's been too wild for me for so long."""
"Wow! I told you we had to get some water. But cheer up! He died as he was: drunk as a king. Poor boy! I feel sorry for him, too."
"One simply misses an old comrade, even if he has played the worst tricks on me and caused me much grief. He is barely twenty-seven, it seems; that is your age: who would have thought you would live less than a year? I must confess, this blow struck me harder than the shock of Mrs. Linton's death: old memories still tormented me; I sat on the veranda and wept like a relative, begging Mr. Kenneth to fetch another servant to present him to the master. I could not help thinking of the question, ""Did he play fairly?"" Whatever I did, the thought kept haunting me: it was so painfully persistent that I decided to ask permission to go to Wuthering Heights and pay my respects to the dead."
"Mr. Linton was very hesitant, but I defended him eloquently, explaining that my old man and my foster brother were just as entitled to my services as he was. I also reminded him that the Hareton child was his wife's nephew, and since there were no close relatives, he should act as guardian. He had to deal with the inheritance and attend to his brother-in-law's affairs. He was unable to attend to such matters at the time, but asked me to speak to his lawyer, and eventually he allowed me to leave."
"His lawyer was also from Earnshaw. I drove to the village and asked him to accompany me. He shook his head and advised me to leave Heathcliff alone. He assured me that if the truth came out, Hareton would be little more than a beggar. ""His father died in debt,"" he said. ""The entire estate is mortgaged, and the natural heir's only recourse is to induce the creditor to treat him leniently."" When I arrived at Heights, I explained that I had come to see how things were. Joseph, who seemed somewhat sad, expressed his pleasure at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he hadn't realized I was needed; but I could stay to arrange the funeral if I wished. ""Quite right,"" he remarked, ""that fool's body should be buried at the crossroads without much ceremony."""
"I left him alone for ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in the meantime he slammed both house doors in my face and spent the night drinking himself to death! We broke in this morning, for we heard him playing like a horse; and there he was lying on the sofa: skinning and scalping him would not have roused him. I sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not before the animal was reduced to carrion: he was dead, cold, and dead; so you will admit it was useless to make any more noise about him! The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered, ""I wish he had gone to the doctor himself! I have just got a tent from the master, a better one than he—and he wasn't dead when I went, not at all!"" I insisted on a proper burial. Mr. Heathcliff said I could do what I liked, but he wished to remind me that the money for the whole thing came out of his own pocket."
"He seemed hard and careless, expressing neither joy nor sorrow, but rather a raw satisfaction at a job well done. Once, I even caught a brief glimmer of joy on his face: it was just as the people were carrying the coffin out of the house. He had the hypocrisy of a mourner: before following Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child onto the table and murmured with strange enthusiasm: ""Now, my dear, you're mine! And let's see if one tree doesn't grow as crooked as another, blown by the same wind!"" The innocent man was delighted by these words: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers and stroked his cheek; but I guessed the meaning and remarked dryly, ""The boy must come back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir."""
"Nothing in the world belongs to you less than he does! ""Did Linton say so?"" he asked. ""Of course he ordered me to take him,"" I replied. ""Well,"" said the villain, ""let's not talk about it now, but I intend to raise a child; I know your master so well that if he tries to take him away, I must take his place beside mine. I won't leave Hareton unchallenged, but I'll make sure the other one comes! Don't forget to warn him."" This hint was enough to tie our hands. I repeated the gist of the matter on my return; and Edgar Linton, who had shown little interest at first, said nothing more about interference."
"I don't know if he could have done it intentionally, or if he would have wanted it. The guest was now the lord and master of Wuthering Heights: he held it firmly in his hands and proved to the lawyer, who in turn proved it to Mr. Linton, that Earnshaw had mortgaged every inch of his land to satisfy his gambling addiction; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. Thus Hareton, who was now to be the most important man in the neighborhood, found himself in utter dependence on his father's inveterate enemy; living as a servant in his own house, without any wages, utterly unable to earn a living, friendless, and unaware that he had been wronged."
"The twelve years following that dark time, Mrs. Dean continued, were the happiest of my life. My greatest worries during that time were the little aches and pains of our little lady, which she had to endure like all children, rich or poor. Besides, after the first six months, she had grown like a larch and could walk and talk in her own way before the heather bloomed again over Mrs. Linton's dust. She was the sweetest thing that ever brought sunshine into a deserted house: a face of real beauty, with the lovely dark eyes of the Earnshaws, but also the fair skin, fine features, and curly blond hair of the Lintons."
"She was cheerful without being brutal and had a sensitive heart, ready for excessive affection. This capacity for intense affection reminded me of her mother, albeit in a different way: She could be gentle and tender as a dove, and she had a soft voice and a thoughtful expression. Her anger was never furious; her love was never passionate, but deep and tender. One must admit, however, that she also had weaknesses that negated her talents."
"A penchant for impudence was part of it, as was a perverse will that spoiled children inevitably develop, whether they are well-behaved or grumpy. If a servant accidentally provoked her, the answer was always, ""I'll tell Papa!"" And if he reprimanded her, even with just a look, it would break your heart: I don't think he ever said a single harsh word to her. He took full responsibility for her upbringing and made it his own pleasure."
"Fortunately, her curiosity and sharp mind made her a capable student: she learned quickly and enthusiastically and followed her lessons conscientiously. Until she was thirteen, she never left the park alone. Mr. Linton sometimes took her for walks of about two kilometers, but never entrusted her to anyone else."
"Gimmerton was an insignificant name to her; the chapel was the only building she had ever approached or entered, apart from her own house. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she lived in complete retirement and apparently perfectly happy. Sometimes, as she looked out of her nursery window at the scenery, she would ask, ""Ellen, how long will it be before I reach the top of these hills? I wonder what is on the other side; is it the sea?"" ""No, Miss Cathy,"" I answered, ""they are hills again, like these."" ""And what do those golden rocks look like when you stand under them?"" she asked one day."
"The steep slope of the Penistone Cliffs caught her attention, especially when the setting sun illuminated them, casting the highest peaks and the entire surrounding landscape into shadow. I explained to her that they were bare masses of rock, with barely enough earth in their crevices to support a stunted tree. ""And why do they shine here so long after dark?"" she continued. ""Because they are much higher than we are,"" I replied. ""You can't climb them; they are too high and too steep. In winter, the frost always comes before us; and in late summer, I found snow beneath that black hollow to the northeast!"" ""Oh, you've been there before!"" she cried cheerfully. ""Then I can go there too, when I'm a woman."""
"Was Papa there, Ellen? ""Papa would tell you, Miss,"" I answered hastily, ""that it's not worth visiting. The moors where you walk with him are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the loveliest place in the world."" ""But I know that park, and I don't know this,"" she murmured. ""And I should love to look down on the surroundings from that high spot: my little pony, Minny, will take me."" When one of the maids mentioned the Fairy Grotto, she turned her head this way and that, eager to undertake the project; she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he promised that she would make the trip when she was older. But Miss Catherine measured her age in months, and ""Am I old enough now to go to Penistone Crags?"" was the question she was constantly asking herself."
"The road wound all the way to Wuthering Heights. Edgar didn't have the courage to venture there, so he was often told, ""Not yet, my dear, not yet."" I explained that Mrs. Heathcliff had left her husband more than twelve years ago. Her family was in poor health; neither she nor Edgar possessed the health common in that area."
"I do not know exactly what her last illness was; I suppose they died of the same disease, a kind of fever that began slowly but was incurable, and rapidly destroyed their lives towards the end. She wrote to her brother to inform him of the probable issue of her four months' illness, and urged him to visit her if possible; for she had much to do and wished to take leave of him and leave Linton safely in his care. She hoped Linton would remain with him as he had been with her: her father, she liked to tell herself, would undertake neither her support nor her education."
"My master did not hesitate to comply with her request: although she was reluctant to leave the house for her usual visits, he quickly rushed to meet her and answer her. Catherine ordered me to be especially vigilant during his absence and repeatedly ordered her not to leave the park; even under my supervision, he did not expect her to go alone. He remained absent for three weeks. For the first two days, my pupil sat in a corner of the library, too busy to read or play. In this tranquil state, she gave me little trouble; but then came a period of impatient and irritable fatigue; and since I was then too busy and too old to entertain her, I devised a way to amuse her."
"I often sent her for walks around the grounds, sometimes on foot, sometimes on a pony, and on her return I patiently welcomed her in all her adventures, real or imagined. The summer seemed to be at its best; she enjoyed these solitary walks so much that she often managed to stay away from breakfast until tea-time; and then she spent her evenings telling her fantastic stories. I had no fear that she might go too far; for the gates were usually guarded, and I thought she would hardly venture out alone if they were wide open."
"Unfortunately, my confidence proved misplaced. One morning at eight o'clock, Catherine came to me and told me she was an Arab merchant who would be crossing the desert with her caravan that day. I was to provide her with ample provisions for herself and her animals: a horse and three camels, accompanied by a large hunting dog and two pointing dogs. I gathered a generous supply of delicacies and hung them in a basket on the side of the saddle. She jumped up, cheerful as a fairy, protected from the July sun by her broad-brimmed hat and gauze veil, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my wise advice not to gallop and to return early."
"The mischievous animal didn't appear during tea. A traveler, the hunting dog, an old dog enjoying his leisurely stroll, returned; but Cathy, the pony, and the two pointers were nowhere to be seen. I sent messengers down one path, then another, then another, and finally set out to find him. A laborer was working on a fence surrounding a plantation at the edge of the property."
"I asked him if he had seen our young lady. ""I saw her this morning,"" he replied. ""She wanted me to cut down a hazel tree for her, and then she bounded her Galloway over the hedge where it lay lowest and galloped out of sight."" Imagine how I felt when I heard this news. I knew at once that she must be on her way to Penistone Crags. ""What will happen to her?"" I cried, squeezing through a gap the man was repairing and running straight for the main road. I marched like a punter for mile after mile until, around a bend, I could see the Heights; but I could see Catherine neither far nor near."
"The Crags are about four kilometers from Mr. Heathcliff's house, which in turn is five kilometers from the Grange. I therefore began to fear that it would be dark before I could reach them. ""What if she had gone and crept in,"" I wondered, ""and been killed, or broken a bone or two?"" My wait was truly agonizing; and at first, I felt a delicious relief when I saw Charlie, the fiercest of the Magi, run past the farmhouse and lie down under a window with a swollen head and a bleeding ear. I opened the gate and ran to the door, knocking vigorously to get in. An acquaintance of mine who lived in Gimmerton opened the door; she had been employed there as a maid since Mr. Earnshaw's death. ""Ah!"" she said, ""you are looking for your little mistress! Have no fear."""
"She's safe here, but I'm glad it's not the master. ""Then he's not home?"" I gasped, panting with panic and haste. ""No, no,"" she answered. ""He and Joseph are gone, and I don't think they'll be back for another hour or two. Come in and rest a bit."" I went in and saw my homeless lamb sitting by the fire, rocking in a little chair that had belonged to his mother as a child. Her hat was hanging on the wall, and she seemed quite relaxed. She was laughing and chatting in the best humor imaginable, while Hareton—now a tall, sturdy boy of eighteen—stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment, hardly understanding the whirlwind of remarks and questions that incessantly escaped his lips. ""All right, miss!"" I cried, hiding my joy behind a glare. ""This will be your last walk until Papa comes back."""
"""I won't trust you on the threshold again, you naughty girl!"" she cried, jumping up gaily and running up to me. ""I'm going to tell you a nice story tonight; and that's how you caught me. Have you ever been here before?"" she cried, putting on her hat and going in at once. ""I'm so sorry for you, Miss Cathy: you've made a dreadful mistake! There's no use sulking and crying; it won't make up for the trouble I had in searching for you all over the country. To think that Mr. Linton asked me to keep you in the house, and you just run off like that! That shows you're a cunning little vixen, and no one will ever trust you again. What have I done?"" she sobbed, interrupting him at once. ""Papa didn't ask me anything: he doesn't scold me, Ellen, he's never cross like you!"" ""Come on, come on!"" I repeated. I tied the ribbon."
"""Let's stop arguing. Oh, what a pity! You're thirteen and a baby!"" This exclamation was provoked by her pushing back her hat and retreating to the fireplace, out of my reach. ""No,"" said the chambermaid, ""don't be too hard on the pretty girl, Mrs. Dean. We made her stop; she wanted to go on for fear of embarrassing you."""
"Hareton offered to accompany her, and I thought he should: it's a wild road through the mountains. Hareton kept his hands in his pockets throughout the conversation, too embarrassed to speak; though he didn't seem to appreciate my intrusion. ""How long must I wait?"" I asked, ignoring the woman's intervention. ""It will be dark in ten minutes. Where's the pony, Miss Cathy? And where's Phoenix? I'll leave you alone if you don't hurry; then do it yourself."" ""The pony's in the yard,"" she replied, ""and Phoenix's locked up there. He's been bitten, just like Charlie."""
"I wanted to tell you everything, but you are in a bad mood and don't deserve to hear it. I took her hat and went over to give it to her. But when she saw that the people in the house were supporting her, she ran about the room. When I pursued her, she ran like a mouse over, under, and behind the furniture, making every pursuit ridiculous. Hareton and the woman laughed, and she laughed along with them, becoming more and more impudent. Until, in complete annoyance, I exclaimed, ""Why, Miss Cathy, if you only knew whose house this is, you would like to go."" ""It's your father's, isn't it?"" she said, turning to Hareton. ""No,"" he answered, lowering his eyes and blushing shyly. He could not bear her stare, even though it was only his. ""Whose, then? Your master's?"" she asked."
"He blushed even more, his emotions altered, muttered a curse, and turned away. ""Who is his master?"" the girl continued wearily, begging for my favor. ""He spoke of 'our house' and 'our people.' I thought he was the lord of the manor's son. And he never said 'Miss': he should have if he were a servant?"" Hareton turned black as a thunderstorm at these childish words. I shook my questioner mutely and finally managed to persuade her to leave. ""Now fetch my horse,"" she said, addressing her unknown relative as the manor's groom. ""And you may come with me."""
"I want to see where the goblin hunter turns up in the swamp and hear about the FAIRIES, as you call them. But hurry! What is it? Go and get my horse, I tell you.' 'I'd sooner have you damned than become your servant!' growled the boy. 'You'll show me WHAT!' asked Catherine in surprise. 'Good heavens, you impudent witch!' he retorted. 'Listen, Miss Cathy! You see you've fallen into good company,' I interrupted. 'Fine words for a young lady! Don't argue with him, please. Come, let's find Minny ourselves and then be off.' 'But Ellen,' she cried, looking astonished, 'how dare he speak to me like that? Mustn't he be forced to do what I ask? Vile creature, I'll tell Papa what you said.' 'Come!' Hareton seemed oblivious to this threat; tears of indignation welled up in his eyes. 'Bring in the pony,' she cried, turning to the woman, 'and untie my dog at once!' 'Steady, Miss,' she replied. 'You lose nothing by being civil. Although Mr. Hareton is not the master's son, he is your nephew, and I have never been obliged to serve you.' 'He is my nephew!' cried Cathy with a contemptuous laugh. 'Yes, indeed,' replied her interlocutor. 'Oh, Ellen! Don't let them say such things,' she continued with great effort. 'Father has gone to London to fetch my nephew. My nephew is a gentleman's son.'"
"""That's my—"" She paused and wept heartily, overcome by the mere thought of an affair with such a clown. ""Shh!"" I murmured. ""One may have many cousins of all kinds, Miss Cathy, and yet one does not suffer for them; only they do not need one's company when they are disagreeable and nasty."" ""He is not—he is not my cousin, Ellen!"" she continued, feeling a new surge of grief at the thought and throwing herself into my arms to protect herself from it. ""I was very annoyed at their mutual revelations, she and the maid; I did not doubt that Linton's impending arrival, which Linton had informed me of, had been reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and I felt equally certain that Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to demand an explanation of his accusations regarding his uncouth relatives."" Hareton, who had recovered from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by his grief; and after leading the pony to the door, to appease it, he brought from the stable a fine, bow-legged terrier, held it out to it, and commanded it to whistle! For it would say nothing."
"She paused, looked at him with an expression of fear and disgust, and then cried again: ""I could hardly suppress a smile at this dislike for the poor fellow. He was a well-built, athletic, handsome, robust, and healthy young man, but he wore clothes suited to his daily pursuits: working on the farm, lounging on the moor, hunting rabbits and deer. Yet I thought I recognized in his features a mind more perfect than his father's."""
"Well-understood things were lost in a wilderness of weeds whose luxuriance far exceeded their neglected growth; yet signs were discernible of a fertile soil which, under other and more favorable circumstances, might yield bountiful harvests. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him violently, thanks to his intrepid nature, which left no room for the temptation to oppress him: he possessed none of the anxious susceptibility which, according to Heathcliff, would have made abuse tempting. He seemed to have taken advantage of his wickedness to transform him into a brute: he had never learned to read or write; had never censured a bad habit that did not irritate his companion; had never taken a step towards virtue, nor had he been protected from vice by a single precept."
"And, as I understand, Joseph contributed significantly to his downfall by harboring a narrow-minded prejudice that led him, from an early age, to flatter and cajole him, for he was the head of the family. And just as he had accused Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, as children, of over-trying their master's patience and forcing him to console himself with alcohol by their 'wicked behavior,' as he called it, so he now laid the entire burden of Hareton's failings on the usurper of his estate. Even when the boy cursed, he did not correct him, however guilty."
"Joseph evidently felt satisfaction in seeing him persevere: he admitted that the boy was ruined, that his soul was doomed; but then he remembered that Heathcliff would have to pay the price. Hareton's blood would be exacted from him; and this thought gave him great comfort. Joseph had instilled in him pride in his name and lineage; had he dared, he would have stirred hatred between himself and the current owner of the Heights; but his fear of that owner was superstition; and he limited his feelings toward him to whispered allusions and private conversations."
"I do not claim to know much about life at Wuthering Heights at that time; I speak only from hearsay, for I saw little of it. The villagers claimed that Mr. Heathcliff was in the neighborhood and was a cruel and severe landlord to his tenants; but under the management of a woman, the house had regained its former comfortable character, and the boisterous scenes common in Hindley's time no longer occurred. The master was too gloomy to seek the company of people, good or bad; and he still is."
"But that doesn't get me anywhere. Miss Cathy rejected the terrier's peace offering and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix. They arrived limping and with their heads hanging; and we went home in utter despair."
"I couldn't get any explanation from my little lady as to how she had spent the day, except that, as I suspected, the destination of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags. She reached the farm without incident when Hareton happened to appear, accompanied by two dogs that attacked his retinue. They fought fiercely before their masters could separate them: this was an introduction. Catherine explained to Hareton who she was and where she was going, and asked him to show her the way. Eventually, she succeeded in persuading him to accompany her."
"He revealed the secrets of the Fairy Grotto and twenty other strange places. However, as I had fallen from grace, I received no credit for describing the interesting objects she had seen. I concluded, however, that her guide had been a favorite until she offended him by calling him a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper offended her favorite by calling him her nephew."
"Then the language he had used with her began to irritate her. She, who had always been ""my darling,"" ""my sweetheart,"" ""my queen,"" and ""my angel"" to everyone at the Grange, was to be insulted in such a shocking way by a stranger! She didn't understand; and I had to make a great effort to extract from her a promise not to complain to her father. I explained to her how he disapproved of the whole Heights household and how upset he would be if she had been there; but above all, I insisted that if she revealed my violation of his instructions, he might become so angry that I would have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear the prospect: she gave her word and kept it. After all, she was a dear little girl."
"A black-bordered letter announced the day of my master's return. Isabelle had died; he wrote to me to arrange his daughter's funeral and to reserve a room and other accommodations for his young nephew. Catherine, delighted at the prospect of welcoming her father, indulged in the wildest hopes regarding the myriad qualities of her ""real"" nephew. The evening of her expected arrival arrived."
"Since early morning she had been busy with her little affairs; and now, in her new black dress—poor thing! Her aunt's death hadn't really affected her—her constant anxiety compelled me to accompany her to the park to join them. ""Linton is only six months younger than I,"" she chattered, as we strolled quietly in the shade of the trees over the hills and valleys of mossy grass. ""How wonderful it will be to have him for a playmate! Aunt Isabella sent Papa a beautiful lock of her hair; it was lighter than mine, blonder, and just as beautiful. I keep it safe in a little glass case, and have often thought how wonderful it would be to see its owner again. Oh! I'm glad—and Papa, dear Papa! Come, Ellen, let's run! Come, let's run."" She ran and came back and ran again, several times before my quiet footsteps reached the gate. Then she sat down on the grassy bank at the side of the road and tried to wait patiently; but it was impossible: she couldn't sit still for a minute. ""How long they're taking!"" she cried. ""Ah, I see, a bit of dust on the road... they're coming! No! When will they be here? Can't we walk a bit, half a mile, Ellen, just half a mile? Say yes: as far as the clump of birch trees at the bend!"" I firmly refused."
"Finally, their suspense was over: the moving carriage appeared. Miss Cathy let out a scream and spread her arms when she saw her father's face out the window. He got out, almost as impatient as she was; and it was a while before they could think of anything but themselves."
"As they caressed each other, I glanced at Linton. He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined coat, as if in winter. The pale, thin, effeminate boy could have mistaken him for my master's younger brother, so striking was the resemblance; but his appearance had a sickly, sullen quality that Edgar Linton had never possessed."
"He noticed my glance, shook my hand, and advised me to close the door and leave him alone, as the journey had tired him. Cathy would have liked to have a look, but her father ordered her to come along, and they went together to the park, while I hurried to get the servants ready. ""Now, my dear,"" said Mr. Linton to his daughter as they stopped at the bottom of the stairs, ""your nephew is not as strong and cheerful as you are, and he lost his mother, as you remember, only recently; so don't expect him to be playing and romping with you just yet. And don't disturb him too much with your chatter: let him be quiet tonight at least, will you?"" ""Yes, yes, Papa,"" replied Catherine, ""but I want to see him; and he hasn't looked out yet."" The carriage stopped; the sleeper was awakened and set down by his uncle. ""This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,"" he said, clasping their hands. ""She already loves you, and be careful not to upset her by crying tonight."""
"Try to be cheerful now; the journey is over, and you have nothing to do but rest and enjoy life as you please. ""Then let me go to bed,"" replied the boy, shrinking from Catherine's greeting, and drying with his fingers the tears that had begun to flow. ""Come, come, there's a dear child,"" I murmured as I led him in. ""You'll make her cry too, see how she pities you!"" I don't know if it was on his account, but his cousin looked as sad as he did and went back to her father. The three went inside and went up to the library, where tea was ready. I began to take off Linton's cap and coat and set him on a chair at the table; but no sooner had he sat down than he began to cry again."
"My master asked what was wrong. ""I can't sit on a chair,"" the boy sobbed. ""Then go to the sofa, Ellen will bring you tea,"" his uncle answered patiently. I was convinced that his whining and sickly pupil had been testing him during the journey. Linton slowly lay down."
"Cathy brought him a stool and his cup. At first, she remained quite silent, but that didn't last long: she had decided to pet her little nephew because she liked him; and she began stroking his curls, kissing him on the cheek, and offering him tea in his saucer like a baby. He was pleased, for he wasn't much better off: he wiped his eyes and smiled faintly. ""Oh, he'll be all right,"" the teacher said to me after watching them for a minute. ""Well, as long as we can keep him, Ellen."""
"The company of a child of his own age will soon give him new energy, and if I wish him to grow up, he will find it. ""Oh, if only we could keep him!"" I said to myself, sensing that there was still a glimmer of hope. And then I wondered: How on earth will this weakling survive at Wuthering Heights? What kind of playmates and teachers will he have between his father and Hareton! Our doubts dissipated immediately, even faster than I expected."
"I had just brought the children up after tea and found Linton asleep—he would not leave me in peace until I left him. I had gone downstairs and was standing at the hall table to light a candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid came out of the kitchen and told me that Joseph, Mr. Heathcliff's servant, was at the door and wished to speak to the master. ""I will ask him what he wants first,"" I said, somewhat anxiously. ""It is an unpropitious time to disturb people, especially when they have just returned from a long journey. I do not suppose the master can see him."" Joseph had crossed the kitchen as I spoke these words and appeared in the hall. He was in his best clothes, with his most moralizing and sullen expression, his hat in one hand, his stick in the other, and was just beginning to polish his shoes on the doormat. ""Good evening, Joseph,"" I said coldly. ""What brings you here tonight?"" ""I've spoken with Master Linton,"" he replied, waving me off. ""Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something specific to say to him, he certainly won't hear you now,"" I continued. ""You'd better sit over there and leave me your message."" ""What is his address?"" the man asked, scanning the row of closed doors."
"I perceived that he was determined to reject my intercession. Reluctantly, therefore, I went to the library and announced the unwelcome visitor, advising him to leave him alone until the next day. Mr. Linton had no time to allow me to do so, for Joseph, who was sitting directly behind me, forced his way into the room, stood on the other side of the table with both fists gripped around the knob of his cane, and began in a loud voice, as if expecting resistance: ""Hathecliff has sent me for his son, and I cannot come back for him."" Edgar Linton was silent for a moment; an expression of deep sorrow came over him: he would have pitied the child for his own sake; but when he thought of Isabella's hopes and fears, her fervent wishes for her son, and her recommendation that he place him in her care, the thought of abandoning him pained him deeply, and he searched in his heart for some way to avoid it. There was no plan: the mere desire to keep him would make the supplicant more convincing: there was no alternative but to abandon him."
"He didn't want to wake him, though. ""Tell Mr. Heathcliff,"" he answered calmly, ""that his son is coming to Wuthering Heights tomorrow. He's in bed and is too tired for the whole journey. You can also tell him that Linton's mother wanted to leave him in my care; and at the moment his health is very poor."" ""Noah!"" said Joseph, dropping to the ground and sounding imperious. ""Noah! It means nothing."""
"Hathecliffe cares neither for the mother nor for you Northerners; but he will nurse his boy, and I will take him—you know that now!—You will not do that tonight! Linton resolutely replied. Go downstairs at once and tell your master what I said. Ellen, bring him down. Go—"" And he helped the indignant elder with a raised arm, cleared the way, and closed the door. ""Goodbye!"" cried Joseph, backing away slowly. ""Tomorrow he will come himself, and he will cast him out if you dare! To prevent this threat from coming true, Mr. Linton ordered me to bring the boy home early on Catherine's pony. And he said: - Since we now have no influence on his fate, either for good or for ill, you must not tell my daughter where he has gone. She can no longer associate with him, and it is better for her not to know of his presence; otherwise she will become restless and long to visit the Heights."""
"Just tell him his father has sent for him urgently and he must leave us. Linton had great difficulty getting out of bed at five o'clock and was surprised to learn that he had to prepare for another journey. But I alleviated the situation by telling him he would be spending some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wanted to see him so badly that he didn't want to wait until he had recovered from his last trip. ""My father!"" he cried, strangely puzzled. ""Mother never told me I had a father. Where does he live? I prefer to stay with my uncle."" ""He lives a little farther from the Grange,"" I replied. ""Just on the other side of these hills: not very far, but you can walk here when you are stronger. And you would be delighted to come home and see him."""
"You must try to love him the way you loved your mother, and then he will love you. ""But why have I never heard of him?"" Linton asked. ""Why didn't they live with Mother like everyone else?"" ""He was up north for work,"" I replied, ""and your mother had to live down south for health reasons."" ""And why didn't Mother tell me about him?"" the child persisted. ""She often spoke of Uncle, and I grew fond of him long ago. How can I love Father? I don't even know him."" ""Oh, all children love their parents,"" I said. ""Your mother might have thought you'd want to be with him if she'd spoken of him so often. Let's go."""
"An early walk on such a fine morning is much better than sleeping an extra hour. ""Is she coming with us?"" he asked, ""the little girl I saw yesterday?"" ""Not now,"" I replied. ""Is Uncle with us?"" he continued. ""No, I'll go,"" I said. Linton sank back onto his pillow and collapsed into a brown writing table. ""I'm not going without Uncle,"" he cried at last. ""I don't know where you're taking me."" I tried to convince him that his bad mood was because he didn't want to see his father; but he stubbornly resisted every attempt to dress, and I had to ask my master for help to get him out of bed. The poor child was finally roused from bed thanks to several fallacious promises of short absence: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other equally unfounded promises, which I made and repeated at intervals during the journey."
"The clean, heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and Minny's sweet song finally dispelled his sadness. He began to think about his new home and its inhabitants with growing interest and animation. ""Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant as Thrushcross Grange?"" he asked, turning to take a last look at the valley, from which a light mist rose to form a fluffy cloud at the edge of the blue. ""It's not so low under the trees,"" I replied, ""and it's not so big, but you can look out over the beautiful scenery; and the air is healthier, fresher, and drier."" At first glance, the house might seem old and gloomy, but it was a respectable one: the second-best in the neighborhood."
"And you will have such lovely walks on the moor. Hareton Earnshaw, that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and therefore in a way yours too, will show you the loveliest places. If the weather is fine, you can take a book and use a green hollow as a desk. And now and then your uncle might come by and walk with you. He often climbs the hills. ""And what is my father like?"" he asked. ""Is he as young and handsome as your uncle?"" ""He is young too,"" I said, ""but he has dark hair and dark eyes and looks sterner. Also, he is getting taller and taller. At first he may not seem very gentle and kind, for that is not his way. Be open and cordial to him. Then, of course, he will love you more than any uncle, for you are his."" ""Dark hair and dark eyes!"" thought Linton. I cannot charm him."
"So I'm not like him, am I? ""Not much,"" I answered; ""not at all,"" I thought, looking with regret at my companion's pale complexion and frail figure, and at his large, dull eyes—his mother's eyes, only, unless momentarily awakened by some morbid frivolity, they no longer contained any trace of their sparkling wit. ""How strange that he never visited mama and me!"" he murmured. ""Did he ever see me? If so, I must have been a baby. I can't remember anything about him!"" ""Well, Master Linton,"" I said, ""three hundred miles is a long way; and ten years is a very different time for a grown man from what is being done for you. Probably Mr. Heathcliff wanted to go away from summer to summer, but never found a suitable opportunity; and now it's too late."""
"Don't bother him with questions about it: that would only upset him, and that's not a good sign. The boy remained completely lost in thought for the rest of the journey, until we stopped at the gate of the cottage garden. I watched him, trying to capture the impressions on his face. He examined the carved facade and the low trellis, the scattered gooseberry bushes and the gnarled firs with serious attention, then shook his head: his personal feelings completely disapproved of the exterior of his new home."
"But he was smart enough to postpone his complaints: Perhaps there would be some compensation. Before he went downstairs, I went to the door and opened it. It was 6:30 a.m.; the family had just finished breakfast; the waiter was busy clearing and wiping the table."
"Joseph stood by his master's chair and told the story of a lame horse; and Hareton prepared for the campaign. ""Hello, Nelly!"" said Mr. Heathcliff when he saw me. ""I was afraid I'd have to go down and get my belongings myself. You brought them, didn't you? Let's see what can be done with them."" He stood up and walked to the door; Hareton and Joseph followed him, open-mouthed and curious. Poor Linton caused a look of fear to appear on the faces of all three. ""Surely,"" said Joseph after a long examination, ""he's changed places with you, sir, and you're his daughter!"" Heathcliff, who had been staring forlornly at his son, laughed contemptuously. ""My goodness! What a beauty! What a sweet, charming creature!"" he cried. ""Didn't they feed him snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn it!"" But this is worse than I expected, and the devil knows I wasn't optimistic! I ordered the trembling, helpless child to go downstairs and into the house."
"He didn't quite understand his father's words, or even whether they were directed at him. He wasn't yet sure if this grim, mocking stranger was his father. But he clung to me with growing fear; and when Mr. Heathcliff sat up and commanded him, ""Come here!"" he buried his face in my shoulder and wept. ""Touhou!"" said Heathcliff, reaching out, pulling him roughly between his knees, and then lifting his head by the chin. ""No joke! We won't hurt you, Linton—is that your name? You're every inch your mother's son! What's my part, clever fellow?"" He took off the boy's cap and brushed back his thick blond curls, feeling his thin arms and little fingers. During this inspection, Linton stopped crying and raised his large blue eyes to scrutinize the inspector. ""Do you recognize me?"" "" asked Heathcliff, after assuring himself that all his limbs were equally frail and weak. ""No,"" replied Linton, looking alarmed. ""I suppose you've heard of me?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""No! What a shame for your mother that she never awakened your filial affection for me! You are my son, I can tell you, and your mother was a real bitch when she told you what sort of father you had. Now don't start trembling and dyeing your hair! Although it is something to see that you have no white blood."""
"Be good, I'll take care of it. Nelly, if you're tired, you can sit down; if not, go home. I hope you'll report what you see and hear to the secretary at the Grange; the matter won't be settled until you've thought it over. ""Well,"" I replied, ""I hope you're kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you won't have him long; and that's all you have in the wide world of acquaintance, as far as you know—don't forget that."" ""I'll be very kind to him, you needn't be afraid,"" he laughed. ""But no one else needs to be kind to him: I'm jealous of claiming his affections for myself."""
"And first of all, Joseph, bring the boy breakfast. Hareton, you damned calf, get to work. ""Yes, Nell,"" he added as he left, ""my son is the future owner of your property, and I don't want him to die before I'm sure he'll be his successor."""
"Besides, he belongs to me, and I long for the triumph of my descendant, who will become lord and master of his lands; my child hires his children to work for hire on their fathers' lands. That is the only reason I tolerate this boy: I despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he evokes in me! But this consideration is enough: he is safe with me and will be cared for with the same care that your master cares for his own house. I have a room upstairs, beautifully furnished, for him; I have also engaged a tutor who comes three times a week from about thirty kilometers away to teach him everything he wishes to learn."
"I commanded Hareton to obey him and did everything I could to maintain his superiority and mastery over his colleague. I regret, however, that he is so little worthy of this trouble: if ever I wished to bestow upon him a blessing, it was to find in him a worthy pride; and I am deeply disappointed in this pale, whiny wretch! While he was speaking, Joseph returned with a bowl of porridge and set it before Linton. He stirred the meager mixture with disgust, protesting that he could not eat it. I saw that the old servant shared his master's contempt for the child; though he was forced to keep it to himself, for Heathcliff evidently thought his inferiors held him in high esteem. ""Can't he eat?"" he repeated, staring at Linton and lowering his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard. ""But Master Hareton ate nothing else as a boy; and what suited him will suit you, I suppose!"" ""I won't eat it!"" ""Take it away!"" Linton retorted sharply. ""Take it away."" Joseph indignantly snatched the food and brought it to us. ""Is there anything wrong with this food?"" he asked, holding it under Heathcliff's nose. ""What's the matter?"" he asked. ""Phew!"" Joseph replied, ""the fine fellow says he can't eat it."""
"But I think it's true! His mother was the same: We were almost too dirty to sow the grain for his bread. ""Don't tell me about his mother,"" the man said angrily. ""Just give him something to eat. What does he usually eat, Nelly?"" I suggested boiled milk or tea, and the housekeeper was instructed to make some. Well, I thought, his father's selfishness might well contribute to his well-being."
"He is aware of his fragility and knows that he must be treated with tolerance. I go to comfort Mr. Edgar by explaining to him how Heathcliff's mood has changed. Since I have no reason to stay longer, I sneak away, while Linton timidly rebuffs the advances of a friendly German Shepherd."
"But he was too watchful to be deceived: just as I was closing the door, I heard a cry and a desperate repetition of the words: ""Don't leave me! I won't stay here! I won't stay here!"" Then the bolt opened and shut: they wouldn't let him out. I mounted Minny and set her trotting; thus ended my short watch. That day we had a sad task with little Cathy: she rose full of joy, eager to go to her cousin, and the news of his departure excited such passionate tears and wailing that Edgar himself had to console her by saying he would soon return; but he added, ""When I get him back""; and there was no more hope."
"This promise hardly reassured her; but time was stronger. And although she still occasionally asked her father when Linton would return, his features were so blurred in her memory that she no longer recognized him. Whenever I met the housekeeper from Wuthering Heights on a business trip to Gimmerton, I inquired after the young gentleman; he lived almost as withdrawn as Catherine herself and was never seen. I concluded that he was still in poor health and a troublesome resident."
"She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to like him less and less, although he tried to hide it: he detested the sound of his voice and absolutely could not bear to sit in the same room with him for hours on end. They rarely spoke: Linton studied and spent his evenings in a small room they called the parlor, or he lay in bed all day, constantly plagued by coughs, colds, aches, and all sorts of ailments. ""And I have never known such a coward,"" the woman added, ""nor such a cautious person. He will continue if I leave the window open a little longer in the evening."""
"Oh! It's murderous, a breath of night air! And he has to light a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's tobacco pipe is poison; and he always needs sweets and dainties and milk, always, milk forever—no matter how straitened we are in the winter; and he'll be sitting there, wrapped in his fur coat, in his armchair by the fire, with toast and water or something on the fire to sip; and when Hareton comes for him out of pity—Hareton is not bad, though he is brutal—they are bound to part, one cursing, the other weeping. I think the Lord would be pleased to have Earnshaw muffle him, if he weren't his son; and I'm sure he could send him away if he knew half a thing or two about how to get around. But then he won't be tempted: he'll never enter the parlor, and if Linton behaved like that in the house where he is, he'd send him upstairs at once. From this story, I concluded that young Heathcliff's lack of compassion had made him selfish and unpleasant, even if he wasn't originally so. My interest in him faded like snow in the sun. Yet I still felt sorry for him and wished he would stay with us."
"Mr. Edgar encouraged me to inquire. I think he thought highly of him and would have taken the risk of meeting him. One day he recommended that I ask the housekeeper if he had ever been to the village. She told me he had only been there twice, on horseback, with his father. And both times he had pretended to be pregnant for three or four days. This housekeeper left the village, if I remember correctly, two years after his arrival. Another, whom I did not know, took her place. She still lives there today. Time passed as before on the estate, entirely at his pleasure, until Miss Cathy was sixteen."
"We didn't show the slightest joy on her birthday, as it was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Her father always spent the day alone in the library and, at sunset, went to Gimmerton Cemetery, where he often stayed until after midnight. So Catherine could entertain herself."
"That 20th of March was a fine spring day, and after her father had left, my young wife, dressed for going out, came downstairs and told me she wanted to take me for a walk along the edge of the moor. Mr. Linton had given her permission, on condition that we go only a short distance and be back within the hour. ""Then hurry, Ellen!"" she cried. ""I know where I'm going: to where a colony of moor deer has settled. I want to see if they've built any nests."" ""It must be far,"" I answered. ""They don't nest on the edge of the moor."" ""No, they don't,"" she said. ""I was very close by with my father."" I put on my hat and set off without hesitation. She bounded ahead of me, came back to me, and then rose again like a young greyhound; And at first, I found it wonderful to listen to the song of the larks everywhere and to enjoy the gentle, warm sunshine, but also to look at her, my darling and my happiness, with her golden curls falling freely over her back, her radiant cheeks as soft and pure as a wild rose, and her eyes shining with cloudless joy. She was a joyful creature, an angel, then."
"It's a pity she's not satisfied. 'Well,' I said, 'where's your heath, Miss Cathy? We ought to be there: the Grange Park fence is still a long way off.' 'Oh, a little more, just a little more, Ellen,' she kept saying. 'Up the hill, over the bank, and when you're on the other side, I'll have rounded up the birds.' But there were so many hills and banks to climb and cross that at last I grew tired of it and told her we must stop and go back. I called to her, for she was a long way ahead; she didn't hear me or take any notice, for she jumped on her horse anyway, and I felt obliged to follow her. At last she dipped into a hollow; and before I saw her again she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own house; and I saw people stopping her. I was convinced one of them was Mr. Heathcliff himself."
"Cathy had been caught looting, or at least destroying, the grouse nests. The Heights belonged to Heathcliff, and he rebuked the poacher. ""I didn't take any, nor did I find any,"" she said, as I struggled, holding out my hands to confirm her statement. ""I wasn't going to take any, but Papa told me there were plenty here, and I wanted to see the eggs."" Heathcliff looked at me with a nasty grin—a sign of his familiarity with the group and therefore his hostility toward them—and asked who ""Pa"" was. ""Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,"" she replied. ""I thought you didn't know me, or you wouldn't have spoken like that."" ""Then you think Papa is highly valued and respected?"" he asked sarcastically. ""And who are you?"" Catherine asked, looking curiously at the speaker. ""I've seen this man before. Is he your son?"" She pointed to Hareton, the other person, who had only gained mass and strength in two years. He still seemed as clumsy and brutal as ever. ""Miss Cathy,"" I interrupted, ""we'll be there in three hours instead of one."""
"We really must go back. ""No, that man is not my son,"" Heathcliff replied, pushing me away. ""But I do have one, and you've seen him before. And although your nurse is in a hurry, I think you both could use a little rest. Could you walk around this corner of the heath and come to me? Then you'll be home early and receive a warm welcome."" I whispered to Catherine that she must not accept the suggestion; it was out of the question. ""Why?"" she asked loudly. ""I'm tired of walking, and the ground is covered with dew. I can't stay here. Let's go, Ellen."""
"He also says I saw his son. I think he's mistaken, but I suspect he lives there: on the farm I visited on my way back from Penistone Crags. Don't you?"
"Come, Nelly, be quiet, she'll be happy to see us. Hareton, go with the girl. You'll come with me, Nelly. ""No, she won't go to a place like that,"" I cried, trying to free my arm from his grasp. But she was almost at the threshold, turning the corner at full speed."
"Her companion made no pretense of accompanying her; he walked down the street and disappeared. ""Mr. Heathcliff, everything is wrong,"" I continued. ""You don't mean well. And there she will see Linton, and everything will be discussed as soon as we get back; and I will take responsibility."" ""I want her to see Linton,"" he replied. ""He's been looking better lately; he's not often seen. And we'll quickly persuade her to keep this visit a secret: what's the harm?"" ""The trouble is, her father would hate me if he knew I allowed her into your house; and I'm convinced you don't mean well in persuading her to do so,"" I replied. ""My intention is as sincere as can be."""
"""I will inform you of the whole matter,"" he said. ""The two cousins should fall in love and marry. I am generous to your master: his young daughter has no expectations, and if she complies with my wishes, she will be provided for at once as Linton's co-heir."" ""If Linton were to die,"" I replied, ""and his life were entirely uncertain, Catherine would be the heir."" ""No, she would not,"" he said. ""There is no clause in the will guaranteeing this: her estate would go to me; but to avoid quarrels, I desire their union and am determined to bring it about."" ""And I am determined that she will never come with me to your house again,"" I replied as we reached the gate where Miss Cathy was waiting for us. Heathcliff begged me to be silent, led us up the path, and hurried to open the door."
"My young wife looked at him several times as if she didn't quite know what to make of him; but now he smiled when he looked at her and spoke to her in a gentler voice; and I was foolish enough to believe that the memory of his mother would keep him from wishing her ill. Linton stood by the fire. He was walking across the fields, for he had his cap on his head, and called to Joseph to bring him dry shoes."
"He had grown considerably for his age, only a few months and sixteen years. His features were still handsome, and his eyes and complexion shone brighter than I remembered, only a slight sparkle brought about by the pure air and mild sunshine. ""Who is he?"" asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. ""Do you see him?"" ""Your son?"" she said, after looking doubtfully from one to the other. ""Yes, yes,"" he answered, ""but is that the only time you've seen him? Think! Ah! You have a short memory. Linton, don't you remember your cousin, how you were always teasing us about seeing him again?"" ""What, Linton!"" cried Cathy, delightedly surprised at the name. ""Is that little Linton? He's bigger than I am! Are you Linton?"" The young man stepped forward and confessed: She kissed him tenderly, and they watched with amazement the change that time had wrought in her appearance."
"Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was at once plump and slender, with the elasticity of steel, and her whole appearance radiated health and vitality. Linton's look and movements were marked by great languor, and his figure extremely slender; yet the grace of his manner mitigated these defects and did not make him unpleasant. After exchanging many tokens of affection, her nephew went to Mr. Heathcliff, who stood at the door, dividing his attention between the things within and those without: pretending to notice the latter, but in reality noticing only the former. ""And you are my uncle!"" she cried, looking up to greet him. ""I thought I liked you, though you were angry at first."""
"Why don't you go with Linton to the Grange? Being such close neighbors all these years and never seeing each other is strange: why did you do that? ""I went there once or twice too often before you were born,"" he replied. ""Goodness! If you have any kisses left, give them to Linton; they're wasted on me."" ""Naughty Ellen!"" cried Catherine, showering me with generous caresses. ""Naughty Ellen! She wants to keep me out. But from now on, I'll take this walk every morning: may I, Uncle? And sometimes I'll take Papa. Wouldn't you be glad to see us?"" ""Of course,"" replied the uncle with a barely suppressed grimace born of his deep dislike for the two proposed visitors. ""But wait,"" he continued, turning to the young woman. ""Now that I think about it, I'd better tell you."""
"Mr. Linton is prejudiced against me: we quarreled once in our lives with unchristian violence; and if you tell him you are coming here, he will forbid your visits altogether. Therefore, do not speak of it unless you wish to avoid seeing your cousin in the future: you may come if you wish, but you must not speak of it. ""Why did you quarrel?"" asked Catherine, very distressed. ""He thought I was too poor to marry his sister,"" replied Heathcliff, ""and was sorry I had her; his pride was wounded, and he will never forgive me."" ""It is wrong!"" said the young woman. ""I will tell him someday. But Linton and I had nothing to do with your quarrel."""
"Then I won't come here; he'll come to the manor. ""That would be too far for me,"" murmured his cousin. ""Six kilometers would be the limit. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or twice a week."" The father gave his son a look of bitter contempt. ""I'm afraid, Nelly, of losing my job,"" he murmured. ""Miss Catherine, as that fool calls her, will see his worth and send him to the devil. If it were Hareton! Do you know that, for all his degradation, I desire Hareton twenty times a day? I would have loved the boy if he had been anyone else."""
But I think he's safe from his love. I'll confront him about this puny creature if he doesn't do something soon. I'd guess he's barely eighteen.
"Oh, my goodness, what nonsense! He's quite busy wiping his feet and doesn't even look at her. ""Linton!"" ""Yes, Father,"" answered the boy. ""Have you nothing to show your niece, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest? Take her into the garden before you change her shoes, and into the stable to see your horse."" ""Wouldn't you rather stay here?"" asked Linton, turning to Cathy in a tone that expressed his reluctance to move. ""I don't know,"" she answered, with a longing look towards the door, evidently eager to be going. He remained seated and moved closer to the fire. Heathcliff got up, went into the kitchen, then into the yard, and called Hareton."
"Hareton answered, and a moment later they returned. The young man was washing, as his shining cheeks and wet hair testified. ""Oh, I'm asking you, Uncle,"" cried Miss Cathy, remembering the governess's assertion. ""He's not my cousin, is he?"" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""your mother's cousin. Don't you think he's nice?"" Catherine looked at him, puzzled. ""Isn't he a handsome fellow?"" he asked."
"The rude man stood on tiptoe and whispered something in Heathcliff's ear. He laughed; Hareton's expression darkened: ""I've noticed that he's very sensitive to suspicious insults and evidently has a vague sense of inferiority."" But his master or guardian dispelled his frown with the exclamation, ""You'll be our favorite, Hareton! She says you're—"" What? Well, something very complimentary."
"""Here! Go with her to the farm. And behave like a gentleman! Don't swear; don't stare at the young lady if she isn't looking at you, and be prepared to hide your face if she is; and when you speak, speak slowly and don't put your hands in your pockets. Go away and treat her as kindly as possible."" He watched the couple pass by the window."
Earnshaw turned his face completely away from his companion. He seemed to be observing the familiar landscape with the interest of a stranger and artist. Catherine gave him a mischievous glance and expressed mild admiration.
"Then she devoted herself to finding distraction, trotting merrily along while singing a song to make up for the lack of entertainment. ""I've tied his tongue,"" Heathcliff remarked. ""He doesn't even dare utter a syllable! Nelly, do you remember how old he is—no, a few years younger. Have I ever looked so stupid, as 'stupid,' as Joseph says?"" ""Worse,"" I replied, ""because it makes me even grumpier."" ""I enjoy the sight of him,"" he continued, thinking aloud. ""He has lived up to my expectations. If he had been born stupid, I wouldn't be so pleased."""
"But he's not stupid; and I can understand all his feelings because I've experienced them myself. For example, I know exactly what he's going through right now: It's just the beginning of what he's going through. And he'll never be able to escape his pathetic rudeness and ignorance."
"I caught him faster than his infamous father caught me, and even deeper; for he prides himself on his brutality. I taught him to despise everything that isn't bestial, and to consider it stupid and weak. Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him? Almost as proud as I am of mine."
"But there is a difference: one is gold, used for paving stones; the other is polished tin, imitating silverware. Mine has nothing precious about it; yet I shall have the merit of bringing it as far as such a wretched thing can. His had first-class qualities, and these have been lost: worse than useless."
"I regret nothing; he would regret more than anyone but me. And best of all, Hareton loves me infinitely! You'll admit I've surpassed Hindley in that. If that dead villain could rise from his grave and accuse me of the misdeeds of his descendants, I would have the pleasure of seeing them fight against him, outraged that he dares to rant against the only friend he has in the world! Heathcliff grinned devilishly at the thought."
"I didn't answer, as he hadn't expected it. Our young companion, who was sitting too far away to hear what was being said, was beginning to feel ill, probably because he had neglected Catherine's company for fear of fatigue. His father noticed the anxious glances towards the window and the uncertain man taking off his cap. ""Get up, you lazybones!"" he cried with mock cordiality. ""Get them! They're just around the corner, by the beehives."" Linton recovered and left the fireplace."
"The gate stood open, and as he went out, I heard Cathy ask her unsociable maid what that writing above the door was. Hareton looked up and scratched his head like a clown. ""That's some damned good handwriting,"" he answered. ""I can't read it."" ""I can't read it?"" cried Catherine. ""I can read it: it's English. But I wonder what it's for."" Linton sneered: this was his first sign of amusement. ""He doesn't know the alphabet,"" he said to his cousin. ""Would you believe in the existence of such a colossal fool?"" ""Is he quite as he ought to be?"" asked Miss Cathy earnestly. ""Or is he merely ill? I've asked him twice, and each time he's looked so stupid that I don't think he understands me."" ""I can hardly understand, I'm sure!"" Linton repeated his laugh and looked mockingly at Hareton, who genuinely didn't seem to understand him at the moment. ""It's just laziness, isn't it, Earnshaw?"" he said. ""My cousin thinks you're an idiot."""
"Now you're suffering the consequences of your contempt for ""reading,"" as you would call it. Have you noticed his terrible Yorkshire accent, Catherine? ""Well, what's that all about?"" growled Hareton, answering his daily companion with increasing impatience. He was about to continue when the two young people burst into peals of laughter. My mistress, a little boisterous, was delighted to discover that she might be able to turn his strange language into a source of amusement. ""What's that phrase all about?"" sneered Linton. ""Father told you not to use foul language, and without it you can't open your mouth."""
"""Now, try to behave like a gentleman!"" ""If you were no more a girl than a boy, I would beat you on the spot, you poor little thing!"" retorted the furious farmer, stepping back, his face burning with anger and resentment! For he was conscious of the insult and ashamed to be angry about it. Mr. Heathcliff, who, like me, had been listening to the conversation, smiled as he saw him go, but immediately cast a look of curious disgust at the frivolous couple who continued chatting on the threshold. The boy amused himself greatly in discussing Hareton's faults and weaknesses and in relating anecdotes of his exploits; and the girl enjoyed his bold and sharp remarks, oblivious to the malice they showed. I began to hate Linton more than to sympathize with him, and in a way excused his father for thinking him mean."
"We stayed until twelve o'clock. I could not persuade Miss Cathy to leave earlier. But fortunately, my master had not left his lodgings and knew nothing of our long absence. On my return, I would have liked to have informed my ward about the character of the people we had left behind. But she thought I was prejudiced against her. ""Ah!"" she cried. ""You take Papa's side, Ellen. You are partial, I know. Otherwise, you would not have deceived me for so many years by imagining Linton to live far away. I am really terribly angry. Only, I am so glad I can hide it from my face! But you must keep quiet about my uncle. He is my uncle, remember that. And I shall scold Papa for quarreling with him."" And so she went on until I gave up all attempts to convince her of her error."
"She didn't mention the evening visit, as she hadn't seen Mr. Linton. The next day, to my great regret, everything was revealed to me; and yet I didn't regret it: I thought he could assume the responsibility of guiding and warning her better than I could. But he was too timid to justify his desire that she should stay away from the house in the Heights, and Catherine loved good reasons for any restriction that tormented her dear will. ""Papa!"" she cried after the morning greeting, ""guess whom I saw yesterday on my walk on the moor."""
"Ah, papa, you started it! You haven't done it yet, have you? I saw it, but listen, and you'll know how I caught you; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to feel so much pity for me, while I was always hoping for Linton's return, and was always disappointed! She faithfully related her excursion and its consequences to me; and my master, though he gave me more than one reproachful look, said nothing until she had finished. Then, drawing her close, he asked her if she knew why he had deprived her of Linton's retinue. Could she think he meant to deprive her of a pleasure she might innocently have enjoyed? ""It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,"" she answered. ""Then you think I care more for my own feelings than for yours, Cathy?"" he said. ""No, it wasn't because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; he is a most wicked man who delights in hurting and ruining those he hates, given the slightest chance. I knew you couldn't maintain contact with your cousin without coming into contact with him; and I knew he would hate you for my sake. Therefore, for your own good, and no other reason, I made arrangements to ensure that you never come to Linton again."""
"I wanted to explain this to you when you were older, and I'm sorry I've put it off."" ""But Mr. Heathcliff was very kind, Papa,"" remarked Catherine, not at all convinced; ""and he didn't mind our seeing each other. He said I could come to him whenever I liked. Only I couldn't tell you because you quarreled with him and haven't forgiven him for marrying Aunt Isabella. And you won't. It's your fault: at least he wants Linton and me to remain friends, and not you."" My master, seeing that she did not believe in her uncle's bad nature, quickly described his behavior towards Isabella and how Wuthering Heights had fallen to her."
"He could not bear to linger on the subject; for, though he spoke little of it, he still felt for his old enemy the same loathing and disgust which had gripped him since Mrs. Linton's death. ""She might have lived, but for him!"" he repeated constantly and bitterly; and in his eyes, Heathcliff looked like a murderer. Miss Cathy, who knew no other evil deeds than her own little acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, born of her irritability and unconsciousness, and which she repented the same day, was amazed at the darkness of mind which could entertain and conceal thoughts of revenge for years, and carry out its plans resolutely and without a tinge of remorse. She seemed so deeply impressed and shocked by this new view of human nature—which had hitherto been excluded from all her studies and ideas—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject further."
"He simply added: ""You will learn later, my dear, why I want you to avoid his house and his family. Now go back to your pursuits and pleasures and think no more of it."" Catherine kissed her father and, as usual, sat quietly for a few hours, listening to his lessons; then she accompanied him to the park, and the day passed as usual. But when she retired to her room in the evening, and I went to help her undress, I found her kneeling weeping beside his bed. ""Oh dear, what a fool!"" I cried. ""If you were truly sad, you would be ashamed to shed a tear over this little contradiction. You have never felt the slightest sadness, Miss Catherine. Imagine that my master and I were dead and you were alone in the world: how would you feel then? Compare the present situation to such an ordeal, and be grateful to your friends instead of wishing for more."" “I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she replied, “I’m crying for him.”"
"He was hoping to see me tomorrow, and he'll be so disappointed! He'll be waiting for me, and I won't come!' 'Nonsense!' I said. 'Do you think he loves you as much as you love him? Doesn't he have Hareton for company? Not one person in a hundred would mourn the loss of a relative he'd just seen twice in two afternoons. Linton will guess why, and then he'll never notice you again.' 'But can't I write him a few lines and tell him why I can't come?' she asked, getting up. 'And just send him the books I promised to lend him? His books aren't as beautiful as mine, and he was so keen to have them when I told him how interesting they were. Weren't you, Ellen?' 'No, absolutely! Absolutely!' I answered firmly. 'Then he'd write to you, and there'd be no end to the matter.'"
"No, Miss Catherine, we must stop all performances altogether: Papa expects it, and I will see to it. ""But how are we going to write this down—"" she continued imploringly. ""Hush!"" I interrupted. ""We are not going to start your notes. Go to bed."" She gave me a very spiteful look, so spiteful that at first I didn't want to kiss her goodnight. I tucked her in and closed the door angrily; but, half-repentant, I quietly went back, and there it was! Mademoiselle was standing at the table, a blank sheet of paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily disappeared as I came in. ""No one will accept this, Catherine,"" I said, ""if you write it down; and I'll put out your candle now."" I held the fire extinguisher on the fire and received a slap on the hand and a surly ""Angry!"" I left her again, and she bolted the door in one of her worst, most ill-tempered moods. The letter was completed and forwarded to the addressee by a village milkman; however, I learned of it only later."
"Over the weeks, Cathy recovered. However, she developed a strange penchant for hiding in corners by herself. When I approached her while she was reading, she would often jump up and bend over the book, obviously intent on hiding it. Then I would notice loose sheets of paper sticking out of the pages. She also had a habit of coming downstairs early in the morning and loitering in the kitchen as if waiting for something. She had a small drawer in a bookshelf that she would fiddle with for hours, carefully removing the key each time she left. One day, as she was inspecting this drawer, I noticed that the toys and knick-knacks that had recently been in it had become folded pieces of paper."
"My curiosity and suspicion were aroused; I decided to take a look at her mysterious treasures. That evening, when she and my master had safely arrived upstairs, I searched for a suitable key for the lock and soon found it among my house keys. After opening the key, I poured the entire contents into my apron and carried it to my room to examine it in peace. Although I couldn't suppress my suspicions, I was nevertheless astonished to discover that they were a wealth of letters—no doubt almost daily—from Linton Heathcliff: replies to documents she had sent me."
"The previously dated letters were embarrassingly short; yet they gradually developed into voluptuous, absurd love letters, appropriate to the writer's age, though with a few hints that I suspected had been borrowed from a more experienced source. Some struck me as particularly odd, a mixture of passion and superficiality; they began with strong emotions and ended in the affected, verbose style a schoolboy might display toward a spoiled, superficial lover. I don't know if Cathy appreciated them; in any case, they seemed like empty words to me."
"After looking through as many as I thought necessary, I wrapped them in a handkerchief, laid them aside, and closed the empty drawer. As was her custom, my young wife went downstairs early and visited the kitchen: I saw her open the door as a certain little boy arrived; and while the milkmaid was filling his eyes, she put something into her coat pocket and took something out. I walked through the garden and waited for the messenger; he bravely defended his confidence, and we spilled the milk between us; but I managed to summarize the letter; and, under threat of serious consequences if he disregarded it, I stood under the wall and read Miss Cathy's touching essay."
"It was simpler and more eloquent than her cousin's: very beautiful and very funny. I shook my head and went home to meditate. Since it was raining, she couldn't enjoy a walk in the park; so after her morning studies, she sought refuge in the cozy drawer."
"Her father was sitting at the table reading; I had deliberately tried to occupy a few untouched edges of the curtain while I watched his activities attentively. Never had a bird returning to a plundered nest, which it had left full of twittering young, expressed its despairing cries and flapping of wings with such intensity as she did, with her single ""Oh!"" and the change that had come over her once cheerful face. Mr. Linton looked up. ""What is the matter, my dear? Are you hurt?"" he asked."
"Her tone and her look assured him that he hadn't discovered the treasure. ""No, Papa!"" she gasped. ""Ellen! Ellen! Come up, I feel sick!"" I obeyed and escorted her outside. ""Oh, Ellen! You've got it,"" she began at once, and fell to her knees when they were alone. ""Oh, give it to me, and I'll never do it again! Don't tell Papa. Didn't you tell Papa, Ellen? You say you haven't? I've been incredibly naughty, but I won't do it again!"" With a stern look, I ordered her to stand up. ""Well,"" I exclaimed, ""Miss Catherine, you seem to have made pretty good progress; you might be ashamed of yourself! You're no doubt studying a nice little volume of nonsense in your spare time; well, it's going to be printed!"" And what will the professor think when I show it to him? I haven't shown it to him yet, but don't you think I keep your ridiculous secrets to myself. Shame on you! And you must have taken the initiative to write such nonsense: he wouldn't have even thought of it, I'm sure.' 'Not me! Not me!' sobbed Cathy, almost inconsolably. 'I never for a moment thought of loving him...' 'LOVE!' I cried with as much contempt as I could muster. 'LOVE! Has anyone ever heard of that? I might as well be talking about love for the miller who comes once a year to buy our grain.'"
"What words of love! And both times in succession you have only seen Linton for four hours in your life! And here is this childish confusion. I am going with them to the library; and we shall see what your father thinks of such LOVE. She rose abruptly to take her precious letters, but I held them above my head; then she begged me more desperately to burn them—to do more than merely exhibit them. And as I would have laughed as much as scolded—for I considered it all girlish vanity—I finally gave in and asked: ""If I consent to burn them, will you sincerely promise me never to send or receive another letter, book (for I see you have sent her books), lock of hair, rings, or toys?"" ""We will send no toys,"" cried Catherine, whose pride overcame her shame. ""And nothing at all, madam?"" ""I said. ""If you don't want me to do it, I'll go."" ""I promise, Ellen!"" she cried, grabbing my dress. ""Oh, throw her in the fire, do it, do it!"" But when I cleared the way with the poker, the sacrifice was too painful to bear."
"She begged me to save her one or two. ""One or two, Ellen, for Linton!"" I untied the handkerchief and began tossing them aside, the flame spiraling up the chimney. ""I'll have one, you rascal!"" she cried, reaching into the fire and pulling out a few half-burned pieces of pottery. ""Well, and I'll have some to show Papa!"" I answered, putting the rest back into the bundle and turning towards the door. She threw her blackened pieces of pottery into the flames and signed to me to finish burning them. This was done; I stirred the ashes and buried them under a shovelful of embers; and silent and deeply wounded, she retired to her room."
"I went downstairs to tell my master that the young lady's nausea had almost disappeared, but I thought it best if she lay down for a while. She refused to eat, but reappeared for tea, pale, with red eyes, and a remarkably dejected expression. The next morning, I answered the letter with the inscription: ""Master Heathcliff is requested not to send any further letters to Miss Linton, as she will not receive any."" And from then on, the little boy returned empty-handed."
"Summer was drawing to a close, and autumn was already beginning: Michaelmas had already passed, but the harvest was late that year, and some of our fields were still unharvested. Mr. Linton and his daughter were regularly out with the reapers; they stayed until dusk to gather the last sheaves, and as the evenings were cold and damp, my master caught a bad cold that clung stubbornly to his lungs and kept him almost continuously indoors all winter. Poor Cathy, frightened by her little love affair, had since become considerably sadder and more gloomy; and her father insisted that she read less and exercise more."
"She no longer had his company. I considered it my duty to substitute for his absence, as far as possible, with my own: an ineffective substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours of my many daily duties to retrace his steps, and my company was then decidedly less tempting than his. One afternoon in October or early November—a cool, damp afternoon, with the grass and paths rustling with damp, withered leaves, and the cold, blue sky half-obscured by clouds—dark gray threads rising rapidly from the west and heralding torrential rains—I begged my young lady to break off her walk, as I was sure there would be showers. She refused. and I reluctantly put on a coat and took my umbrella to accompany her on a walk to the end of the park: a formal walk which she generally took, even when it was gloomy—and she invariably took it when Mr. Edgar behaved worse than usual, which she never learned from his confession, but which we both gathered from her increasing silence and the melancholy in her expression."
"She continued sadly: Running or jumping was no longer an option, even though the cold wind might have tempted her to do so. And often I saw with my own eyes how she raised her hand and wiped her cheek. I looked around, looking for a way to distract her."
"On one side of the road rose a high, precipitous slope, on which stunted hazel bushes and oaks with half-exposed roots lay precariously positioned: the ground was too soft for the latter, and fierce winds had blown some of them almost horizontal. In summer, Miss Catherine loved to climb these trunks and perch in the branches six meters above the ground; and I, charmed by her agility and light, childlike heart, still thought it proper to scold her whenever I surprised her so high up, but only so that she would know it was useless to come down. From dinner until tea, she lay in her cradle rocking in the breeze and did nothing but sing old songs to herself—my nursery tradition—or watch the birds, her roommates, feeding their young and encouraging them to fly away; Or she nested with the lid closed, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express. ""Look, miss!"" I called, pointing to a niche beneath the roots of a gnarled tree. ""Winter isn't here yet."""
"Above it rises a tiny flower, the last bud of the many bluebells that in July enveloped these lawn steps in a purple haze. ""Will you climb up and pick it to show Papa?"" Cathy stared for a long time at the solitary flower trembling in its earthy shelter, and finally answered, ""No, I won't touch it. But it looks melancholy, doesn't it, Ellen?"" ""Yes,"" I remarked, ""about as starved and famished as you—your cheeks are drained of blood; let's join hands and start walking. You're so dejected, I bet I could keep up with you."" ""No,"" she repeated, and walked leisurely on, pausing now and then to look at a blade of moss, a clump of bleached grass, or a toadstool losing its bright orange hue among the piles of brown leaves; and from time to time she laid her hand on her averted face. ""Catherine, why are you crying, darling?"" I asked, coming to her and putting my arm around her shoulders. ""You mustn't cry because Papa has a cold. Be glad it's not worse."" She couldn't hold back her tears any longer; her breath caught in her throat. ""Oh, it's getting worse,"" she said. ""And what will I do if you and Papa leave me and I'm left alone? I can't forget your words, Ellen; they still ring in my ears."""
"How life will change, how dark the world will be when you and Dad are dead. ""No one can predict that you won't die before us,"" I replied. ""It's wrong to predict the worst. We hope that many years will pass before one of us dies: the Lord is young, I am strong and barely forty-five. My mother lived to eighty, a wise woman to the end."""
"And if Mr. Linton were spared until he was sixty, that would be more years than you counted, Miss. And wouldn't it be foolish to mourn a misfortune that happened over twenty years ago? ""But Aunt Isabel was younger than Papa,"" she remarked, looking up with a faint hope for consolation. ""Aunt Isabel had neither you nor me to look after her,"" I replied. ""She wasn't as happy as Master: she didn't have as much to live for. You just have to take good care of your father and comfort him by letting him see you happy; and not worry him: Remember, Cathy! I won't hide it from you, but you could kill him if you were foolish and rash, if you had a foolish and fanciful affection for the son of a woman who would gladly keep him in his grave; and if you let him find out that you were worried about the separation he thought desirable. - ""I'm not worried about anything except Papa's illness,"" replied my companion. ""Compared to Papa, I don't care at all."""
"And I will never, never, oh never, while I have any sense, do a deed or a word that can torment him. I love him more than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; for I would rather be unhappy than see him unhappy: that proves I love him more than myself. ""Fine words,"" I answered. ""But the deeds must prove it too; and if he is well, remember that one does not forget one's resolutions in difficult times."" As we talked, we approached a gate that opened on the street side; and my young wife, again lit by the sun, climbed and sat on the top of the wall to gather rose hips that bloomed scarlet on the upper branches of the wild roses that shaded the street: the lower fruits were gone, but only birds could touch the upper ones, except from Cathy's present vantage point. As she reached out to pick it, her hat fell from her head; and as the door was locked, she offered to go down and get it."
"I told her to be careful, or she'd fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the way back wasn't easy: the stones were smooth and neatly arranged, and the remaining rose bushes and blackberries offered no purchase on the climb. Like an idiot, I didn't remember until I heard her laugh and exclaim, ""Ellen! You have to get the key, or I'll have to run to the gatehouse."""
"""I can't climb the city wall like this!"" ""Stay where you are,"" I replied. ""I have my ring of keys in my pocket. Perhaps I can open it; if not, I'm leaving."" Catherine danced merrily in front of the door while I tried all the large keys one after the other. I had pressed the last one, but none worked. I repeated my wish that it would stay there and was about to run home as fast as possible when an approaching noise startled me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dancing also stopped. ""Who is it?"" I murmured. ""Ellen, I wish you could open the door,"" my companion murmured anxiously. ""Ho, Miss Linton!"" called a deep voice (that of the horseman), ""pleased to meet you."""
"Don't hurry, for I must demand and receive an explanation. ""I won't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,"" replied Catherine. ""Father says you are a bad man, and you hate him and me; and Ellen says the same."" ""That matters not,"" said Heathcliff. (He did.) ""I don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is to him that I draw your attention. Yes, you have cause for shame. Weren't you in the habit of writing to Linton two or three months ago? Love out of lust, was it? You both deserved a whipping for that! Especially you, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out."""
"I have your letters, and if you're a bit impertinent, I'll send them to your father. I suppose you've had enough of the fun and stopped, haven't you? Well, you left Linton in a quagmire of despair. He was sincere: genuinely in love."
"As long as I live, he dies for you; your unbelief breaks his heart: not figuratively, but literally. Although Hareton has behaved like a fool towards him for six weeks, and I have taken stricter measures to discourage him from his folly, he is getting worse every day; and before summer comes, he will be buried if you do not bring him to his senses! ""How can you lie so openly to the poor child?"" I cried inwardly. ""Go on! How can you deliberately tell such vile lies? Miss Cathy, I will blow the castle down with a stone: you will not believe such dreadful nonsense. You yourself know that a man cannot possibly die for love of a stranger."" ""I did not know there were indiscreet ears,"" murmured the exposed villain. ""My dear Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I do not like your duplicity,"" he added aloud. ""How could you lie so openly about your hatred of the 'poor child'? And invent horror stories to make her run away from me?"" Catherine Linton (I like that name), my dear, I'm away all week; go and see if you haven't been telling the truth: do so, there's a treasure in it! Imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then consider how much you would value your careless lover if he refused to comfort you, even though your father himself begged him to; and don't, through sheer stupidity, make the same mistake."
"I swear by my salvation that he will go to the grave, and no one but you can save him!' The lock gave way, and I went out. 'I swear, Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking me straight in the eye. 'And grief and disappointment will hasten his death. Nelly, if you don't let her go, you may go through it yourself. But I won't be back until next week, and I think your master himself would not much object to her visiting her cousin.' 'Come in,' I said, taking Cathy by the arm and forcing her inside; for she stood scrutinizing the features of my interlocutor with an anxious look too stern to express her deep disappointment."
"He urged his horse closer and leaned forward. He said, ""Miss Catherine, I must confess that I have little patience with Linton, and even less with Hareton and Joseph. I must confess that he is a hard-hearted man. He longs for kindness as much as love, and a kind word from you would be his best medicine."""
"Ignore Mrs. Dean's cruel warnings, but be generous and go to him. He dreams of you day and night and cannot be convinced that you do not hate him, since you neither write nor call him. I closed the door and rolled in a stone to secure the loose lock. And as I opened my umbrella, I lowered my armor: the rain began to rattle through the creaking branches of the trees, warning us to avoid delay. Our haste prevented us from discussing the meeting with Heathcliff on the way back; but I instinctively sensed that Catherine's heart was now shrouded in double darkness."
Her face was so sad it looked as if it wasn't hers: she obviously took what she had heard for granted. The professor had already gone to bed when we arrived. Cathy sneaked into his room to ask how he was; he had fallen asleep.
"She came back and asked me to go to the library with her. We drank tea together; then she lay down on the carpet and told me not to talk, she was tired. I picked up a book and pretended to read."
"As soon as she noticed that I was completely absorbed in my activity, she began to weep softly again: it seemed to be her favorite pastime at that moment. I let her enjoy it for a moment; then I protested: I mocked and ridiculed Mr. Heathcliff's statements about his son, as if I were sure she would agree with me. Unfortunately, I had no talent for neutralizing the effect of his narrative: it was precisely what he meant. ""You may be right, Ellen,"" she replied, ""but I shall never be at peace until I know."""
"And I must tell Linton that it is not my fault if I do not write, and convince him that I will not change. What good is anger and protests against his foolish credulity? We parted that evening in disagreement; but the next day I found myself on the road to Wuthering Heights, beside the pony of my wayward young mistress. I could not bear the sight of her: her pale, dejected face, her heavy eyes; and I gave in, in the faint hope that Linton himself would prove by his reception how little truth there was to the story. The rainy night had given way to a misty morning—half frost, half fog—and now and then streams crossed our path, trickling down from the uplands."
"My feet were wet; I was sullen and dejected—just the right frame of mind to make the best of these unpleasant circumstances. We went into the farmhouse kitchen to see if Mr. Heathcliff was really gone; for I only half believed him. Joseph seemed to be sitting alone in a kind of Elysium by a roaring fire; a quart of beer stood beside him on the table, strewn with large pieces of toasted oatcakes; and he had his short black pipe in his mouth."
"Catherine ran to the fireplace to warm herself. I asked if the Lord was there. My question went unanswered for so long that I thought the old man was going deaf, so I repeated it louder. ""No... ah!"" he cried, or rather, he cried through his nose. ""No... ah! You must go back where you came from."" ""Joseph!"" a rough voice called at the same time as me from the back of the room. ""How many times must I call you? There are only a few clouds of red ash left. Joseph! Come!"" His energetic expression and his determined gaze into the fireplace showed that he had not heard this plea."
"The housekeeper and Hareton were nowhere to be seen; one was out, the other probably at work. We recognized Linton's tone and went inside. ""Oh, I hope you're starving in a garret!"" said the boy, mistaking us for the careless servant. He stopped abruptly when he realized his mistake: his cousin was rushing toward him. ""Is that you, Miss Linton?"" he asked, raising his head from the arm of the large armchair in which he was leaning. ""No, don't kiss me; it would take my breath away."""
"""My goodness! Papa said you were coming,"" he continued, recovering a little from Catherine's embrace as she stood contritely. ""Would you please close the door? You left it open; and these—these horrible creatures don't put coals on the fire. It's so cold!"" I poked the embers and fetched a bowl for myself. The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a bad cough and seemed feverish and ill, so I didn't reprimand him. ""Well, Linton,"" Catherine murmured, her frown relaxing, ""are you glad to see me? Can I help you?"" ""Why didn't you come sooner?"" he asked. ""You should have come instead of writing."""
Writing these long letters has exhausted me terribly. I would have much preferred to talk to you. Now I can neither talk nor bear anything else.
"I wonder where Zillah is! Could you (with an eye to me) go into the kitchen and see? I had received no thanks for my other services; and not wishing to rush off at his request, I answered, ""There's nobody here but Joseph."" ""I want a drink!"" he cried irritably, turning away. ""Zillah has been going to Gimmerton's since Papa left: it's miserable! And I must come here; they've decided never to listen to me upstairs again."" ""Is your father considerate to you, Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked, observing that Catherine's friendly advances were reserved. ""Considerate? He makes her a little more considerate, at any rate,"" he cried. ""Those scoundrels! You know, Miss Linton, that dirty Hareton laughs at me! I hate him!"" ""Indeed, I hate them all: they're dreadful creatures."" Cathy went in search of water. She placed a carafe on the sideboard, filled a glass, and brought it over. He asked her to pour a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table. After drinking a little, she seemed calmer and said she was very pleasant. ""And you're glad to see me?"" she asked, repeating her previous question. She was pleased when a faint smile appeared on his face. ""Yes, quite. It's new to hear a voice like yours!"" he replied. ""But I was annoyed that you didn't want to come."""
"And papa swore it was all my fault: he called me a poor, poor good-for-nothing, and said you despised me, and that in my place he would be a better master of the manor than your father. But you do not despise me, Miss—? —I wish you would say Catherine or Cathy, interrupted my young lady. Despise you? No! Except papa and Ellen, I like you better than anyone else. However, I do not like Mr. Heathcliff, and I dare not come if he comes. Will he be away many days? —Not much, replied Linton; but he often goes to the moor since the hunt began, and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence."
"Say that. I don't think I should be so angry with you: you wouldn't provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help me, wouldn't you? ""Yes,"" said Catherine, stroking his long, soft hair, ""if Papa would allow me, I'd spend half my time with you. Nice Linton! I wish you were my brother."" ""And then you'd love me as much as your father?"" he remarked more cheerfully. ""But Papa says you'd love me more than him and everything in the world if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were."" ""No, I'd never love anyone more than Papa,"" she answered seriously. ""And sometimes people hate their wives, but not their brothers and sisters: and if you were the latter, you'd live with us, and Papa would love you as much as me."" Linton denied that one could ever hate one's wives. Cathy, however, confirmed this and, in her wisdom, pointed out her own father's dislike of her aunt."
"I tried to silence her. I only succeeded after she had told everything. Master Heathcliff, extremely annoyed, claimed her story was false. ""Papa told me, and Papa doesn't lie,"" she retorted rudely. ""My papa despises yours!"" cried Linton. ""He calls him cunning and stupid."" ""Your papa is a bad man,"" retorted Catherine, ""and you have the nerve to repeat everything he says."""
"He must have been wicked to let Aunt Isabella go so easily. ""She didn't leave him,"" said the boy; ""you won't argue with me."" ""Yes, she did,"" cried my young wife. ""Well, I'll tell you!"" said Linton. ""Your mother hated your father: well!"" ""Oh!"" cried Catherine, too angry to speak further. ""And she loved mine,"" he added. ""Little liar! Now I hate you!"" she gasped, her face red with rage. ""It was she! It was she!"" crooned Linton, sinking back in his chair and leaning his head back to enjoy the excitement of the other quarrelsome man behind him. ""Hush, Mr. Heathcliff!"" I said; ""I suppose that's your father's story too."" ""It isn't so: be quiet!"" he answered. It was she, it was she, Catherine! It was she, it was she! Cathy, beside herself, violently kicked the chair over, hurling it against an armrest. He immediately suffered a choking coughing fit that put an end to his triumph. It lasted so long that even I was frightened."
"His cousin wept heartily, stunned by the chaos she had caused, but she said nothing. I held him in my arms until the attack was over. Then he pushed me away and bowed his head in silence."
"Catherine, too, suppressed her groans, sat down opposite her, and gazed gravely into the fire. ""How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?"" I asked after ten minutes. ""I wish she felt as I do,"" he replied. ""What a vile, cruel man! Hareton never touched me: he never beat me all his life. And today I felt better: and then—"" His voice broke into a groan. ""I didn't beat you!"" murmured Cathy, biting her lip to suppress another outburst of emotion. He sighed and groaned like one in deep pain and continued to do so for a quarter of an hour; evidently to get even with his cousin, for every suppressed sob she unleashed doubled her pain and pathos. ""I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,"" she finally said in unbearable agony. ""But that little push can't hurt me, and I didn't think you could be hurt either: you're not a man, are you, Linton? Don't make me go home thinking I hurt you."""
"Answer! Speak to me. —I cannot speak to you, he murmured. You have hurt me so much that I lie awake all night choking on this cough. If you had it, you would know what it is; but you will sleep soundly, while I live in agony with no one near me. I wonder how you would like to spend these dreadful nights! And he began to groan aloud, out of pure pity. —Since you are accustomed to spending dreadful nights, I said, it will not be Mademoiselle who disturbs your sleep; you would be as if she had never come."
"But she won't bother you anymore; and perhaps you'll be calmer if we leave you alone. ""Shall I go?"" asked Catherine gloomily, leaning towards him. ""Shall I go, Linton?"" ""You can't help it,"" he answered sullenly, drawing back, ""unless you make things worse by irritating me until I get a fever."" ""Then I must go?"" she repeated. ""Leave me alone at least,"" he said; ""I can't bear your talking."" She stood there, resisting my attempts to leave for a weary moment; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she at last went to the door, and I followed her. A shout called us back. Linton had slipped from his chair onto the mantelpiece and was writhing in pain, with the stubbornness of a fractious and self-indulgent child determined to be as serious and disturbing as possible."
"I accurately assessed his state of mind from his behavior and immediately realized that it would be foolish to please him. My companion did not: she ran back in fear, knelt down, wept, consoled, and begged until he fell silent and gasped—and not out of remorse for having upset her. ""I'll lift him onto the sofa,"" I said, ""and he can roll around as he pleases; we can't stand here and watch him. I hope you are convinced, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person who can help him; and that his condition is not due to his attachment to you."""
"Well, there he is! Come on, once he knows no one is bothering him with his nonsense, he'll be glad to lie still. She placed a pillow under his head and offered him water; he refused, throwing himself uncomfortably onto the pillow as if it were a rock or a block of wood. She tried to position him more comfortably. ""I can't do that,"" he said, ""it's not high enough."" Catherine brought another pillow to rest on. ""It's too high,"" murmured the provocative creature. ""How am I supposed to do it then?"" she asked desperately. He pressed himself against her, while she knelt half-beside the bench, using her shoulder for support. ""No, that won't do,"" I said. ""You'll have to be content with the pillow, Master Heathcliff."""
"Miss has already wasted too much time with you; we can't stay more than five minutes. ""Yes, yes, we can!"" answered Cathy. ""He is kind and patient now. He begins to think that I shall be much worse off tonight than he is if I think he is in a worse state when I visit: and then I dare not come. Tell the truth, Linton; for I must not come if I have hurt you."" ""You must come and cure me,"" he answered. ""You must come, for you have hurt me; you know you have hurt me very much! I wasn't as sick when you came as I am now, was I?"" ""But you made yourself sick by crying and getting angry. I had nothing to do with it,"" said his cousin. ""But we shall be friends now."""
"And you desire me? You really want to see me? ""I told you,"" he replied impatiently. ""Sit on the sofa and let me lean on your lap. Mother always did that in the afternoons. Stay very still and don't speak. But you can sing a song, if you can sing; or you can recite a beautiful, long, interesting ballad—one of those you promised to teach me—or a story."""
"""But I would prefer a ballad—begin!"" Catherine repeated for as long as she could remember. The task pleased them both immensely. Linton wanted another and another, despite my strongest objections; and so they continued until the clock struck midnight, and we heard Hareton in the courtyard returning to supper. ""And tomorrow, Catherine, will you be there?"" asked young Heathcliff, clutching his gown and rising reluctantly. ""No,"" I answered, ""nor the day after."" She evidently gave a different answer, for her brow lit up as she bent down and whispered in his ear: ""You're not going away tomorrow, remember, miss!"" I began, once we were out of the house. ""You're not dreaming of it, are you?"" She smiled. ""Oh, I'll be very careful,"" I continued. ""I'll have the lock mended, or you won't be able to escape."" ""I'll get through the wall,"" she laughed. “The barn is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my jailer.”"
"And besides, I'm almost seventeen: I'm a woman. And I'm sure Linton would soon recover if I took care of him. I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, aren't I? And with a little encouragement, he'll soon do as I say."
"He's a treasure when he's good. I'd make him my darling if he were mine. We shouldn't quarrel anymore, now that we've gotten used to each other. Don't you love him, Ellen? ""Good!"" I cried. ""He's the most ill-tempered, sickly creature a man ever became."""
"Fortunately, as Mr. Heathcliff had suspected, he won't gain twenty years. I doubt he'll live to see spring. And it would be a small loss to his family if he were to fall again."
"And how fortunate for us that his father adopted him: the more kindly he was treated, the more boring and selfish he would become. I'm glad you won't be getting him as your husband, Mademoiselle Catherine. My companion became serious during this speech. Speaking of his death with such indifference pained her. ""He is younger than I am,"" she replied after much thought, ""and he is the one who will live the longest: He will live, he will live as long as I will."""
"He is as strong now as he was when he came north; I am sure of it. He is only troubled by a cold, just like Papa. You say Papa will be well again, and why should he not? 'Now, now,' I cried, 'let us not worry; for listen, Miss—and you know, I keep my word: if you attempt to return to Wuthering Heights, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and if he does not consent, your friendship with your cousin must not be resumed.' 'She is well,' murmured Cathy sullenly. 'Then it must not go on like this,' I said. 'We shall see,' she answered, and ran off, hardly leaving me alone."
"We were both home before dinner; my master assumed we had been out for a walk in the park and therefore didn't ask for an explanation for our absence. As soon as I arrived, I hurried to change my soaked shoes and socks; but the long sitting on the heights had taken its toll. The next morning I was in bed, unable to perform my duties for three weeks: a catastrophe I had never experienced before and am glad I haven't experienced again since."
"My little mistress came like an angel to care for me and ease my loneliness; the delivery was extremely depressing. It's exhausting for a body brimming with energy: few people have as much to complain about as I do. As soon as Catherine left Mr. Linton's room, she appeared at my bedside."
"Her day was divided between us; not a moment of conversation was lost: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her games; and she was the most beloved nurse there ever was. She must have had a kind heart, since she loved her father so much that she gave me so much. I used to say that her days were divided between us; but the governess went to bed early, and I usually didn't need anything after 6 p.m., so the evening belonged to her."
"Poor girl! I never thought about what she did with herself after tea. And although I often noticed a fresh blush on her cheeks and a rosy glow on her slender fingers when saying goodnight, I didn't imagine the sentence she had borrowed on a cold walk across the moor, but placed it on the blazing fire in the library. After three weeks, I was able to leave my room and move around the house."
"And as I lay awake that night, I asked Catherine to read to me, as I had been slacking off. We were in the library, and the mistress was already in bed. She agreed, though somewhat reluctantly, I think. And, imagining that she didn't like my kind of books, I asked her to choose what she wanted to read. She chose one of her favorites and walked quietly for about an hour. Then she kept asking me questions. ""Ellen, aren't you tired? Lie down for a bit? You're sick from staying up so late, Ellen."" ""No, no, dear, I'm not tired,"" I answered again and again."
"When she saw me motionless, she tried to express her disgust at what I had done in another way. She yawned, stretched, and said, ""Ellen, I'm tired."" ""Forget it and talk,"" I replied. Even worse, she brooded and sighed, looked at the clock until 8:00, and finally returned to her room, completely overcome by sleep, judging by her heavy, sullen expression and the constant rubbing of her eyes."
"The following night, she seemed even more impatient; and on the third day after finding me again, she complained of a headache and left me. I found her behavior strange; and after we had been alone for a long time, I decided to ask her if she was feeling better and ask her to lie down on the sofa instead of staying upstairs in the dark. I found Catherine neither upstairs nor downstairs."
"The staff confirmed they hadn't seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar's door; everything was quiet. I returned to his apartment, extinguished my candle, and sat by the window."
"The moon shone brightly; a thin layer of snow covered the ground, and I thought she might have taken it into her head to stroll into the garden and get some fresh air. I saw a figure steal behind the park fence; but it was not my young mistress: in the light, I recognized one of the grooms. He stood for a long time, looking at the road that led through the park; then he moved away quickly, as if he had noticed something, and reappeared a moment later, Mademoiselle's pony at his side; and there she was, just dismounted, walking beside him."
"The man stealthily resumed his work across the grass toward the stable. Cathy came in through the living room window and quietly crept over to where I was waiting for her. She, too, carefully opened the door, took off her snow-white shoes, tied on her hat, and, oblivious to my observation, was just about to take off her cloak when I suddenly stood up and revealed myself."
"Surprise paralyzed her for a moment; she uttered an inaudible cry and stood frozen. ""My dear Miss Catherine,"" I began, too overcome by her recent kindness to reprove her, ""where have you gone at this hour? And why are you trying to deceive me with a story? Where have you been? Speak!"" ""To the end of the park,"" she stammered. ""I told no story."" ""And nowhere else?"" I asked. ""No,"" she murmured. ""Oh, Catherine!"" I cried dolefully. ""You know you have done wrong, or you need not have been driven to lie. It grieves me. I would rather be ill for three months than see you invent a deliberate lie."" CHAPTER XXIV She jumped up, burst into tears, and threw herself on my neck. ""Well, Ellen, I am afraid you are angry,"" she said. ""Promise me you won't be angry, and you'll find out the truth: I don't mean to hide it."" We sat down on the windowsill. I assured her I wouldn't scold her, whatever her secret might be, and sure enough, I guessed it. So she began: ""I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I haven't been away a day since you were taken ill; except three times before, and twice since you left your room."
"Every evening, I gave Michael books and pictures so he could get Minny ready and take her back to the stable: you can't scold her, you know. I was at The Heights at 6:30 p.m. and usually stayed there until 8:30 p.m., then I quickly went home. I didn't go there to entertain myself: I often felt miserable the whole time."
"Sometimes I was happy: perhaps once a week. At first, I thought it would be a real challenge to persuade you to keep Linton's word: after all, I had promised to come back the next day when we left him; but as you had stayed upstairs the day after, I spared myself the inconvenience. That afternoon, while Michael was locking the park gate, I took the key and told him my cousin wanted me to visit him, as he was ill and couldn't come to the Grange; and Papa objected. Then I negotiated with him about the pony."
"He loves reading and is planning to get married soon. So he offered to do anything I wanted if I would lend him some books from the library. But I preferred to give him mine, which he liked better. ""On my second visit, Linton seemed in good spirits; and Zillah (their housekeeper) prepared a clean room and a nice fire for us. She told us we could do as we liked, as Joseph was at a prayer meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was out with his dogs—and, as I later learned, raiding our pheasant woods. She brought me mulled wine and gingerbread and seemed extremely good-natured. Linton sat in the armchair and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth, and we laughed and talked so gaily and had so much to talk about; we made plans about where to go and what to do in the summer. I needn't repeat it, because you would think it absurd."" ""But once we almost quarreled."""
"He said the best way to spend a hot July day was to lie on a moor from morning till night, right in the heart of the moor, with the bees buzzing dreamily among the flowers, the larks singing high overhead, and the sky blue and the sun bright, without cloud or interruption. This was his most perfect idea of heavenly happiness; mine was to swing in a rustling green tree with a west wind and brilliant white clouds passing swiftly overhead; and not only larks, but thrushes, blackbirds, linnets, and cuckoos singing all around, and the moor visible in the distance, broken by cool, dark valleys; but quite close by, great waves of tall grass swaying in the breeze; and woods and rippling waters, and the whole world awake and joyful. He wanted everyone to rest in an intoxication of peace; I wanted everyone to shine and dance in a glorious exultation."
"I said his heaven was half alive; and he said mine was drunk; I said I was falling asleep in his; and he said he couldn't breathe in mine, and was getting out of breath. At last we both decided to try it, as soon as time permitted; and then we kissed and became friends. After we had sat quietly for an hour, I looked around the large room with the smooth, uncarpeted floor, and thought it would be nice to play there with the table gone; and I asked Linton to call Zillah for help, and we would play blind man's buff; she would try to catch us: you did, Ellen. He didn't like it: he didn't like it, he said; but he agreed to play with me."
"We found two in a cupboard, amidst a pile of old toys: tops, hoops, throwing boxes, and springs. One had a C written on it, the other an H. I wanted the C because it stood for Catherine, and the H could have been Heathcliff, his name; but the sound came from H, and Linton didn't like that. I hit him again and again; he got angry again, coughed, and went back to his seat."
"That evening, however, he quickly recovered his good humor: two or three beautiful songs—YOUR songs, Ellen—enchanted him. When I had to go, he asked me to come back the next evening, and I promised. Light as a feather, Minny and I went home, and I dreamed of Wuthering Heights and my beloved niece until morning. The next morning I was sad; partly because you were ill, and partly because I wished my father had known about and approved of my excursions. But after tea, the moonlight was beautiful; and as I walked on, the darkness lifted. I shall have a pleasant evening yet, I told myself; and what will please me more will be my beautiful Linton."
"I trotted to her farm and was about to turn back when a man named Earnshaw approached me, grabbed my bridle, and led me through the front gate. He patted Minny on the neck and told her she was a sweet animal and seemed to want me to talk to her. I just told him to leave my horse alone, or he would kick it."
"He replied in his vulgar accent, ""It wouldn't hurt Mitch if it were so,"" and smiled, examining the paws. I was almost tempted to try it, but he went to the door, lifted the latch, looked at the inscription above it, and said with a mixture of embarrassment and glee, ""Miss Catherine! I'm reading you now."" ""Wonderful!"" I exclaimed. ""Tell us, you've gotten clever!"" He spelled the name, stressing the syllables: ""Hareton Earnshaw."" ""And the numbers?"" I called encouragingly, when he suddenly stopped. ""I can't say them yet,"" he replied. ""Oh, you silly!"" I said, laughing heartily at his failure. The idiot stared at me, smiling and frowning, as if considering whether to join in the laughter: was this pleasant familiarity or, what it really was, contempt? I dispelled his doubts by suddenly becoming serious and asking him to leave, for I had come to see Linton, not him."
"He blushed—I saw him in the moonlight—dropped his hand on the latch, and slunk away, a symbol of wounded vanity. He considered himself as competent as Linton, presumably because he could spell his own name; and he was surprisingly dismayed that I didn't think the same. ""Stop it, Miss Catherine, my dear!"" I interrupted. ""I don't mean to scold you, but I don't appreciate your behavior. If you had considered that Hareton was as much your cousin as Master Heathcliff, you would have understood how unseemly this behavior was."""
"It was certainly a laudable ambition of his to strive for as much success as Linton; and he probably didn't learn it just to show off: you had no doubt already reproached him for his ignorance; and he wanted to correct it and please you. To laugh at his imperfect efforts was a sign of very bad breeding. Had you been brought up under his circumstances, would you have been less rude? He was as lively and clever a child as you are; and it pains me that he is now despised because that wicked Heathcliff treated him so unfairly. ""Well, Ellen, you won't cry, will you?"" she cried, surprised by my earnestness. ""But wait, and then you'll know whether he has twisted his ABCs to please me; and whether it has been worth your while to be civil to the beast."""
"I entered; Linton was lying on the sofa and half rose to receive me. ""I am ill this evening, Catherine, my dear,"" he said, ""and you must talk so that I can listen. Come and sit by me. I felt sure you would not break your word, and I will exact your promise once more before you go."" I knew now that I must not anger him, for he was ill; so I spoke gently, without asking questions, and avoided irritating him."
"I had brought him some of my favorite books. He asked me to read him a passage, and I was about to oblige when Earnshaw, lost in thought, flung open the door. He strode toward us, grabbed Linton by the arm, and threw him off his chair. ""Go to your room!"" he said, his voice barely audible with anger; his face was swollen and furious. ""Take her there when she comes to visit you. You won't lock me out. Get out of here, both of you!"" He cursed us and didn't give Linton time to reply. He almost hurled him into the kitchen. He clenched his fist as I followed, evidently preparing to hit me."
"I was startled for a moment and dropped a book; he hurled it behind me, preventing us from entering. I heard an evil, crackling laugh by the fire, and when I turned around, I saw that loathsome Joseph standing there, rubbing his bony hands, trembling. ""I knew he'd finish you off! He's a good fellow! He's got a good mind! He knows—indeed, he knows as well as I do who's boss around here—Eh, eh, eh! He's got you right! Eh, eh, eh!"" ""Where are we going?"" I asked my cousin, ignoring the old man's sneering remarks. ""Linton was pale and trembling. He wasn't handsome, Ellen: oh no! He looked dreadful; his narrow face and large eyes expressed a panicked, impotent rage."""
"He grabbed the doorknob and shook it: it was locked from the inside. ""If you don't let me in, I'll kill you! If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!"" he screamed, instead of saying it. ""Devil! Devil! I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"" Joseph laughed hoarsely. ""Good heavens, it's Father!"" he cried. ""It's Father! We all have both inside us. Don't be afraid, Hareton, my boy, don't be afraid, he can't touch you!"" I grabbed Linton's hands and tried to pull him away, but he screamed so loudly that I didn't dare go any further. Finally, his screams were drowned out by a violent coughing fit; blood spurted from his mouth and he fell to the floor."
"Terrified, I ran into the yard and called loudly for Zillah. She soon heard me: she was milking cows in a pen behind the barn and had rushed down from her work to ask what was wrong. I could hardly explain; I dragged her inside and looked around for Linton. Earnshaw had gone out to see what he had done and was just mounting the poor animal."
"Zillah and I followed him, but he stopped me at the top of the stairs and told me not to go in: I had to go back. I screamed that he had murdered Linton and I wanted to go in at all costs. Joseph locked the door and told me not to do anything stupid. He asked me if I was as crazy as he was. I stood there crying until the housekeeper came back."
"She assured him he would soon feel better, but he couldn't stand the shouting and noise. So she picked me up and practically carried me to the house. ""Ellen, I could have almost pulled my hair out!"" I sobbed and cried so much I was almost blind. And the villain you sympathize with stood before me: he dared to call me ""Wish"" now and then and denied it was his fault. And finally, terrified by my claims that I would tell Papa and he would be imprisoned and hanged, he began to sob himself and ran out to hide his cowardly excitement. But I wasn't rid of him yet: when they had finally pushed me away and I was only a few hundred yards from the property, he suddenly leaped out of the shadows of the road, stopped Minny, and grabbed me. ""Miss Catherine, I am deeply grieved,"" he began, ""but this is far too much—"" ""I gave him a lash of the whip because I thought he was going to kill me. He let me go, uttered one of his horrible curses, and I galloped home half-mad. I neither said good night to you that evening, nor did I go to Wuthering Heights the next day. I longed to go there, but I was strangely excited, and sometimes I dreaded hearing of Linton's death, and sometimes I shuddered at the thought of meeting Hareton."""
"On the third day, I plucked up the courage: I couldn't stand the waiting any longer, so I sneaked out again. I left at five o'clock, thinking I could sneak into the house and get to Linton's room. But the dogs noticed me."
"Zillah greeted me and said, ""The boy has woken up."" Afterward, I entered a clean, small, carpeted apartment. To my great joy, I saw Linton lying on a small sofa, reading one of my books. But he didn't speak to me for an hour, or even look at me, Ellen: he was in such a bad mood. And what completely surprised me when he opened his mouth was that I had caused the whole commotion with my lie, and it wasn't Hareton's fault! Unable to respond except passionately, I stood up and left the room."
"He sent me a vague ""Catherine!"" He hadn't expected such a reply, but I didn't want to go back; and the next day I stayed home for the second time, almost determined never to visit him again. But it was so painful to go to bed and get up without ever hearing from him that my resolve vanished before it had fully formed. Starting the trip had seemed like a mistake; now it also seemed a mistake to cut it short."
"Michael came and asked if he could saddle Minny. I said ""yes,"" considering myself a chore while she carried me over the hills. I had to pass the front windows to get into the yard; hiding was no use. ""The young master is in the house,"" said Zillah, seeing me approaching the parlor. I went in; Earnshaw was there too, but immediately left the room."
"Linton was half asleep in his large armchair. I stepped to the fire and began in a serious, almost convincing tone: ""Since you dislike me, Linton, and because you think I mean to harm you on purpose, and you behave so every time, this is our last meeting. Let us say goodbye and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you do not wish to see me again and that he should not invent any more lies about it."" ""Sit down and take off your hat, Catherine,"" he replied. ""You are so much happier than I; you ought to be happier. Papa talks so often about my faults and shows me such contempt that I doubt myself. I wonder if I am not as useless as he often tells me; and then I am so angry and bitter that I hate everyone! I am useless, ill-tempered, and bad-tempered, almost always; and if you like, you can say goodbye to me: then you will be rid of a source of annoyance."""
"Only, Catherine, be just to me: believe that if I could be as sweet, kind, and good as you, I would be; as happy, and happier still, as if I were as happy and healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me love you more deeply than if I deserved your love. And though I could not and cannot refrain from revealing my nature to you, I regret it, and will regret it, and will regret it until I die! ""I felt that he spoke the truth; and I felt that I must forgive him; and even if we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we both wept the whole time I stayed: not only from grief, but I was sorry that Linton had such a stubborn disposition."""
"He never leaves his friends alone, and he is never alone himself! Since that evening, I have always gone to his parlor, for his father came again the next day. ""I think we were cheerful and hopeful about three times, just as we were on the first evening; my other visits were gloomy and troubled: sometimes because of his selfishness and resentment, sometimes because of his suffering; but I have learned to bear the former with almost as much resentment as the latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me; I have hardly seen him. Last Sunday, even earlier than usual, I heard him cruelly reproving poor Linton for his conduct the day before."""
"I can't say how he knew, unless he was listening. Linton had certainly behaved provocatively; however, that was entirely my business, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by going in and telling him. He burst out laughing and left. He said he was glad I shared his point of view."
"Since then, I've instructed Linton to whisper his bitter words. ""Ellen, you heard everything. No one can stop me from going to Wuthering Heights unless I cause trouble for two people. If you don't tell Papa, I won't have to bother anyone."""
"You won't tell, will you? That would be cruel of you. ""I'll decide tomorrow, Miss Catherine,"" I replied. ""It requires a little thought; so I'll leave you to think it over alone."" I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; I went directly from his room to hers and told him the whole story, except for his conversations with his cousin and the mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was shocked and upset, more than he cared to admit. The next morning, Catherine learned that I had betrayed her trust, and she also learned that her secret visits would be at an end."
"In vain she wept and writhed against the prohibition, and implored her father to pity Linton. The only consolation she could muster was to promise to write to him, allowing him to come to the Grange whenever he chose, but to explain that he must not see Catherine again at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps he would have seen fit to refuse her even this feeble consolation if he had known of his nephew's state of health. ""These things happened last winter, sir,"" said Mrs. Dean; ""scarcely more than a year ago. Last winter I did not think that in twelve years I should be able to entertain a stranger to the family with this story! But who knows how long you will remain a stranger? You are too young to live alone; and I believe no one can see Catherine Linton without loving her."""
"You laugh; but why do you look so lively and interested when I speak of her? And why did you ask me to hang her portrait over your fireplace? And why—"" ""Stop, my dear friend!"" I cried. ""It is quite possible that I love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to risk my peace by yielding to temptation. And besides, my home is not here. I belong to the busy world and must return to its arms. Go."""
"Did Catherine follow her father's instructions? ""Yes,"" the housekeeper continued. ""Her affection for him was still the deepest feeling in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke with the deep tenderness of one who is about to leave his treasure amidst dangers and enemies, where his words are the only support he can leave her."" A few days later, he said to me, ""I wish my nephew would write to me, Ellen, or call. Tell me honestly what you think of him: has he changed for the better, or is there any prospect of improvement as he grows older?"" ""He is very frail, sir,"" I replied; ""and it is unlikely that he will reach manhood. But one thing I can say: he is not like his father; and should Miss Catherine have the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her grasp unless she showed unusual and foolish indulgence."""
"""But, sir, you'll have plenty of time to get to know him and see if he's right for her: he's over four years old."" Edgar sighed and went to the window to look at Gimmerton Church. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone weakly, and we could just make out the two firs in the garden and the scattered gravestones. ""I have often prayed,"" he said, half-concentrated, ""for what is to come; and now I begin to shrink from it and dread it. I thought the memory of the hour when I came to this valley as a bridegroom would be less sweet than the expectation of soon, in a few months, or perhaps a few weeks, being carried there and laid in that lonely hollow! Ellen, I have been very happy with my little Cathy: winter nights and summer days, she has been a living hope by my side."""
"But I was just as happy meditating alone among these stones beneath this old church: lying the long June evenings on the green mound of her mother's grave, dreaming of the day when I may rest there. What can I do for Cathy? How can I leave her? It would mean little to me that Linton is Heathcliff's son; nor that he has taken her from me, if he could console her for my loss. It would mean little to me that Heathcliff has achieved his purpose and triumphantly taken my last benediction! But if Linton is unworthy—a weak tool for his father—then I cannot leave her to him! And though it is hard to break her good humor, I must mourn her persistently while I live, and leave her alone when I die."
"My darling! I would rather entrust her to God and bury her myself. ""Commit her to God as she is, sir,"" I replied, ""and if we lose you—which he forbids us in his providence—I will stand by his friend and advisor to the end. Mademoiselle Catherine is a good girl: I have no fear that she will deliberately commit evil deeds; and whoever does their duty is always rewarded in the end. Spring was approaching; but my master could not really find the strength for it, although he resumed his walks in the park with his daughter. In her inexperienced opinion, this was already a sign of recovery; and besides, his cheeks were often red and his eyes bright; she was sure he would recover."
"On his seventeenth birthday, he did not go to the churchyard: it was raining, and I said to him, ""You are not going out to-night, are you, sir?"" He replied, ""No, I will put it off until later."" He wrote again to Linton, expressing his sincere desire to see him; and had the invalid been fit to present himself, his father would certainly have given him permission. CHAPTER XXV When, however, he received the instructions, he replied that Mr. Heathcliff had objected to his being appointed to the Grange; but the friendly remembrance of his uncle cheered him, and he hoped to meet him occasionally in his wanderings, and to beg him personally that he and his nephew should not be long so entirely separated. This part of his letter was distinct, and probably his own."
"Heathcliff knew he could eloquently seek Catherine's company. ""I do not require,"" he said, ""that she come here; but shall I never see her again, for my father forbids me to go to her, and you forbid her to come to me? Accompany her now and then to the Heights, and let us exchange a few words in your presence! We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you bear me no grudge: you have no reason to hate me, you yourself admit it. My dear uncle! Send me a kind note tomorrow, and come with me wherever you wish, except Thrushcross Grange. I think a conversation will convince you that my father's reputation is not mine: he claims I am your nephew rather than his son; and though I have faults that make me unworthy of Catherine, she has forgiven me, and for her sake you should do the same."""
"They ask me about my health: I am better; but how can I be cheerful and healthy while I am deprived of all hope, condemned to solitude or the company of those who have never loved me and never will? Edgar, while pitied by the boy, could not grant his request, as he could not accompany Catherine. He said they could meet this summer; in the meantime, he wished him to continue writing to him occasionally and promised to offer him as much advice and comfort as possible by letter, well aware of his difficult situation within his family. Linton complied; and had he not been restrained, he would probably have spoiled everything by filling his letters with complaints and lamentations. But his father kept a close eye on him; and, of course, he insisted that every line my master wrote be published. So instead of writing down his personal sufferings and anxieties, the subjects that constantly preoccupied him, he insisted on the cruel obligation of being separated from his friend and lover. and he kindly indicated that Mr. Linton must grant him an interview promptly, or he might fear that he was deliberately deceiving him by empty promises."
"Cathy was a valuable ally at home; and eventually, they persuaded my master to take a ride or a walk together, under my supervision, about once a week on the moors near the Grange. For in June, his condition was still deteriorating. Although he had set aside a portion of his income each year for my young wife's estate, he naturally wished her to retain her ancestral home, or at least return there soon. He saw his only chance of achieving this in a union with his heir. He did not know that his condition was deteriorating almost as rapidly as his own. And I don't think anyone else did: no doctor went to the Heights, and no one sought out Master Heathcliff to report his condition. For my part, I began to believe that my premonitions were false and that he must really be pulling himself together when he talked of rides and walks on the moors and seemed so determined to pursue his goal."
"I could not imagine a father treating a dying child with such tyranny and cruelty as Heathcliff, as I later learned, to enforce this apparent zeal: his efforts redoubled while his greedy and cruel plans were threatened with death. Summer was past its peak when Edgar reluctantly yielded to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to meet his cousin. It was a sultry, oppressive day: without sun, but with a sky too dull and misty-looking to expect rain; and our rendezvous place had been fixed by the signpost at the crossroads."
"When we reached him, a herdsman's boy, sent as a messenger, told us, ""Master Linton was just this side of the Heights and would be very grateful if we went a little farther."" ""Then Master Linton has forgotten his uncle's first instructions,"" I remarked. ""He ordered us to stay within the grounds of the Grange, and off we go."" ""Good, we'll turn back as soon as we reach him,"" my companion replied. ""We're going home."" But when we reached him, barely 400 meters from his house, we found he had no horse. We had to dismount and let ours graze. He lay on the moor waiting for us and didn't get up for a few meters. He walked so weakly and looked so pale that I immediately called out, ""Master Heathcliff, you are not fit to walk this morning."""
"""How sick you look!"" Catherine looked at him sadly and surprised: the cry of joy on her lips turned into one of concern; and the congratulations on their long-postponed meeting gave way to an anxious question: Was he worse than usual? ""No—better—better!"" he gasped tremblingly, holding her hand as if he needed it, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over hers; the emptiness around them transformed the dull expression they once shared into a wasted wildness. ""But you are worse,"" her cousin persisted; ""worse than the last time I saw you; you have grown thin and—"" ""I am tired,"" he interrupted hastily. ""It is too hot to walk, let us rest here. And I often feel sick in the mornings—Father says I am growing so fast."" Cathy sat down contentedly, and he leaned close against her. ""This is like your heaven,"" she said, trying to sound cheerful. ""Do you remember the two days we were supposed to spend there, and how we both enjoyed it? It's almost your day, only there are clouds, but they're so mild and temperate: more pleasant than sunshine. Next week, if possible, we'll go to Grange Park and try mine."" Linton didn't seem to remember what she was talking about and was obviously struggling to follow the conversation."
"Her disinterest in the subjects she discussed and her inability to contribute to his conversation were so obvious that she could not hide her disappointment. A vague change had affected her entire personality and demeanor. Irritability, which could have been transformed into affection, had given way to a careless apathy; she had less the capricious temper of a child who deliberately seeks to be annoyed than the self-centered, gloomy character of a hardened invalid who rejects consolation and considers the good humor of others an insult."
"Catherine, like me, understood that he felt our company was more of a punishment than a satisfaction, and she didn't hesitate to suggest their immediate departure. This suggestion jolted Linton out of his lethargy and plunged him into a strange state of excitement. He cast an anxious glance toward the Heights and begged them to stay for at least another half hour."
"CHAPTER XXVI ""But I think,"" said Cathy, ""you would be better off at home than here; and I see I cannot now entertain you with my stories, songs, and chatter. You have grown wiser than I during these six months; you have little desire to entertain me now; otherwise, I would gladly stay, if I could entertain you."" ""Rest yourself,"" he replied. ""And, Catherine, don't think or say that I am VERY ill. It is the heavy weather and heat that makes me sleepy; and I walked a great deal alone before you came. Tell my uncle I am well, will you?"" ""I will tell him, Linton. I cannot confirm it,"" remarked my young wife, surprised at his persistence in this obvious lie. ""And come here again next Thursday,"" he continued, avoiding her astonished look. ""And thank him for letting you come."" My sincere thanks, Catherine."
"And—and, if you met my father and he asked you about me, don't let him think I've been unusually quiet and stupid: don't make a sad and dejected face, or he'll be angry."" ""I don't understand his anger,"" cried Cathy, thinking she would be the target of his fury. ""But I do,"" said her cousin, shuddering. ""Do NOT provoke him, Catherine, for he is very harsh."" ""Is he strict with you, Master Heathcliff?"" I asked. ""Has he grown tired of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred?"" Linton looked at me but did not answer. And after remaining by his side for another ten minutes, during which his sleepy head sank upon his breast and he uttered only groans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy sought solace in picking bilberry and shared the fruits of her research with me. She declined, for she saw that any further communication would only be tiring and irritating. ""Half an hour ago, Ellen?"" she finally whispered in my ear. ""I don't see why we should stay. He's asleep, and Papa will want us back."" ""Well, you mustn't let him sleep,"" I replied. ""Wait until he wakes up, and be patient. You were so eager to leave, but your desire to see poor Linton is fading fast!"" ""Why did he want to see me?"" Catherine replied. ""I used to like him better when he was a bit more surly than in his strange state now."""
"It's as if this conversation is a task he has to perform so his father doesn't scold him. But I'm certainly not doing Mr. Heathcliff any favors, whatever his reasons for imposing this penance on Linton. And while I'm glad he's better, I'm sorry he's much less kind and loving toward me. ""So he's better?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""because he always tried so hard to suffer, you know."""
"He is not as well as he told Papa; but he is probably better. ""You disagree, Miss Cathy,"" I remarked; ""I suppose he is much worse."" Linton started in alarm and asked if anyone had called him. ""No,"" said Catherine, ""except in a dream. I don't understand how anyone can fall asleep out of doors in the morning."" CHAPTER XXVI ""I thought I heard my father,"" he gasped, looking up at the high post above us. ""Are you sure no one said anything?"" ""Quite sure,"" replied his cousin. ""It was only Ellen and I who quarreled about your health. Are you really stronger, Linton, than when we parted in the winter?"" If so, I am sure one thing is not stronger: your esteem for me. Speak, won't you? Tears welled up in Linton's eyes as he answered, ""Yes, yes, I am!"" Still captivated by the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down, searching for the owner."
"Cathy stood up. ""We must part today,"" she said. ""And I will not conceal my deep disappointment at our meeting; though I will tell no one but you: not that I have the slightest respect for Mr. Heathcliff."" ""Hush,"" whispered Linton; ""for goodness' sake, hush! He's coming."" He clutched Catherine's arm and endeavored to restrain her; but at the announcement, she wrenched herself hastily free and whistled for Minny, who obeyed him like a dog. ""I'll be here next Thursday,"" she cried, springing into the saddle. ""Goodbye. Hurry, Ellen!"" Thus we left him, scarcely aware of our departure, so preoccupied was he with the prospect of his father's arrival. Before we reached the house, Catherine's discontent gave way to a confused feeling of pity and regret, mingled with vague and anxious doubts as to Linton's true situation, both physical and social. I attended, but advised her not to say too much, as we could form a better opinion after a second trip."
"My master asked me for a report on our activities. His cousin thanked him, and Miss Cathy carefully took care of the rest. I could hardly answer his questions, as I hardly knew what to hide or reveal. Seven days passed, and each one was marked by the rapid deterioration of Edgar Linton's condition."
"The chaos wreaked a few months earlier was now repeated by the whims of the moment. We would have liked to deceive Catherine again, but her sharp mind did not fail her: she sensed this terrible probability and secretly pondered it, which gradually became a certainty. She was not allowed to speak of her Thursday ride; I told her and received permission to take her with me: the library, where her father spent a short time every day—the little time he could sit still—and her room had become her universe."
"She always regretted not being bent over his pillow or sitting by his side. Her face grew pale with sleeplessness and grief, and my master gladly sent her away, for what he flattered himself was a pleasant diversion and companionship, comforted by the hope that she would not be entirely alone after his death. Based on various observations, he was firmly convinced that his nephew would resemble him not only in appearance but also in spirit; for Linton's letters contained scarcely any hint of his faults."
"And I, out of pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the mistake; I wondered what good it would do to disturb his last moments with information he had neither the power nor the opportunity to explain. We postponed our outing until the afternoon; a sunny August afternoon: every breath of the hills was so full of life that it seemed as if he who breathed it, even in dying, might come back to life. Catherine's face was like the landscape: shadows and sunshine passed swiftly across it; but the shadows lingered longer and the sunshine was more fleeting; and her poor little heart reproached itself for having briefly forgotten her cares."
"We watched Linton from the spot he had chosen earlier. My young mistress dismounted and suggested that, as she was determined to stay a little longer, I should hold the pony and ride. But I disagreed: I did not want to lose sight of the mission entrusted to me for a moment. So we rode together up the moorland slope. Master Heathcliff received us with more enthusiasm this time: not with an expression of cheerfulness or joy; it sounded more like anxiety. ""It is late!"" he said briefly and laboriously. ""Isn't your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come."" ""WHY aren't you candid?"" cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. ""Why can't you just say you don't need me?"" ""It is strange, Linton, that you should have deliberately brought me here a second time, apparently to annoy us both, and for no reason at all!"" Linton shuddered and looked at her half pleadingly, half ashamed. But her cousin's patience wouldn't allow her to endure this scheming behavior. ""My father is gravely ill,"" she said, ""and why am I summoned to his bedside? Why didn't you release me from my promise when you wanted me to break it? Come! I need an explanation: fun and games are banished from my mind, and I can't dance to your affectations now!"" ""My affectations!"" he murmured, ""what is that? For heaven's sake, Catherine, don't be so angry! Despise me all you like; I am a coward and a vain creature; I cannot be despised enough, but I am too vile for your anger."""
"""Hate my father and spare me the contempt."" ""Nonsense!"" cried Catherine angrily. ""Silly, stupid boy! And there! He's trembling: as if I were really touching him! You needn't show contempt, Linton: he's spontaneously there for everyone. Go away! I'm going home: it's madness to tear you from the hearth and pretend—what are we pretending? Let go of my dress! If I felt sorry for you because you were crying and looked so frightened, you should reject such pity. Ellen, CHAPTER XXVII, tell him how shameful this behavior is."""
"""Stand up and do not degrade yourself to a contemptible reptile—NO!"" With tears in his eyes and an expression of mortal anguish, Linton threw his weakened body to the ground; he seemed contorted with fear. ""Oh!"" he sobbed. ""I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I am a traitor too, and I dare not tell you so! But leave me, and I will be killed! Dear Catherine, my life is in your hands. And you said you loved me, and if you did, it would do you no harm. So you will not go? Dear, dear, good Catherine! And perhaps you will agree, and he will let me die with you!"" My young wife, seeing his deep anguish, stooped to raise him. The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her anger, and she was deeply moved and troubled. ""Agree to what?"" she asked. ""Stay!"" Explain to me the meaning of this strange conversation, and I will do it."
"You contradict your own words and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once everything that is on your mind. You wouldn't hurt me, would you, Linton? You wouldn't allow an enemy to hurt me if you could help it? I think you are a coward to yourself, but not a treacherous coward to your best friend.' 'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clenching his emaciated fingers, 'and I am afraid of him—I am afraid of him! I dare not say anything!' 'Well!' said Catherine with contemptuous pity, 'keep your secret: I am not a coward. Run away: I am not afraid!' Her generosity brought tears to his eyes: he wept hot tears, kissed her supporting hands, and yet could not summon the courage to speak."
"I pondered the secret and decided that, despite my best wishes, Catherine could never do him or anyone else a favor. Hearing a rustling in the bars, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff coming down the hills almost beside us. He didn't even glance at my companions, although they were close enough to hear Linton's sobs. But he greeted me in an almost cordial tone, one he never adopted for anyone else, and the sincerity of which I could not deny, and said, ""It's strange to see you so near my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange? Keep me informed."""
"""There's a rumor going around,"" he added quietly, ""that Edgar Linton is dying. Are they exaggerating his illness?"" ""No, my master is dying,"" I replied, ""that's true. It will be sad news for us all, but a blessing for him!"" ""How much longer do you think he will last?"" he asked. ""I don't know,"" I answered. ""Because,"" he continued, looking at the two young people who stood quite motionless under his gaze—Linton didn't seem to move or lift his head, and Catherine couldn't move on his account—""because that boy over there seems determined to hit me; and I'd be grateful to his uncle if he'd hurry up and get there first! Hello! Has the little dog been playing this game for long? I've given him a few lessons in whining. Is he generally quite lively with Miss Linton?"" ""Lively?"" ""No, he has shown great distress,"" I answered. ""Looking at him, instead of wandering about in the mountains with his sweetheart, he should be in bed under the care of a doctor."" ""He'll be here in a day or two,"" murmured Heathcliff. ""But first, get up, Linton! Get up!"" he cried. ""Don't crawl down there now!"" CHAPTER XXVII Linton had sunk to the ground again, in a fresh fit of helpless fear, triggered, I suppose, by his father's look: nothing else could humble him so much."
"He tried several times to obey, but his feeble strength left him for a moment, and he fell back with a groan. Mr. Heathcliff came forward, picked him up, and leaned him against a grass verge. ""Now,"" he said with suppressed anger, ""I'm going to have a fit, and if you don't control yourself, damn it! Get up right now!"" ""I will, Father,"" he gasped. ""Leave me alone, or I'll faint. I did what you wanted, I'm sure of it."""
"Catherine will tell you that I... that I... had fun. Oh! Stay with me, Catherine; give me your hand. ""Take mine,"" said her father; ""stay there. Stay there, she'll lend you her arm; yes, look at her."""
"One would think I were the devil himself, Miss Linton, for arousing such terror. Would you be so kind as to escort him home? He trembles when I touch him. ""Dear Linton!"" whispered Catherine. ""I cannot go to Wuthering Heights. Father has forbidden me. He will not harm you. Why are you so afraid?"" ""I can never set foot in that house again!"" he replied. ""I must NOT leave without you!"" ""Stop!"" cried her father. ""We will respect Catherine's childish scruples."""
"Nelly, take him home; I will follow your advice about the doctor at once.' 'You will be well,' I replied. 'But I must stay with my mistress; the care of your son is none of my business.' 'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know, but you force me to pinch the baby and let it cry before it awakens your compassion. Come then, my hero. Will you come back, in my company?' He came towards me again, making as if to seize the defenseless creature; but Linton shrank back, clinging to his cousin, and imploring her with a desperate, implacable persistence to accompany him."
"For all my disapproval, I could not dissuade her: how could she have rejected him? What frightened him so much, we could not discover; yet there he stood, helpless under her sway, and the slightest hint seemed to drive him mad. We reached the threshold; Catherine entered, and I waited while she led the sick man to a chair, only to let him go immediately. Then Mr. Heathcliff called out, pushing me forward: ""My house is free from the plague, Nelly; and I want to welcome you today: sit down, I'll shut the door."" He closed and locked it. I shuddered. ""You shall have some tea before you go in,"" he added. ""I am alone."""
"Hareton has gone to the Lees' with cattle, and Zillah and Joseph are making a pleasant journey. Although I am accustomed to being alone, I would like some interesting company. Miss Linton, sit beside him. I will give you what I have: the gift is hardly worth mentioning; but I have nothing else to offer you."
"I mean, it's Linton. How she stares at me! It's strange how angry I am at everything that seems to frighten me! Were I born in a district where the laws were less strict and tastes less refined, I would treat myself to a slow vivisection of these two for evening entertainment. He gasped, pounded the table, and cursed: ""Goodness! I hate them."" ""I'm not afraid of you!"" cried Catherine, who didn't hear the end of his speech. She came closer, her black eyes flashing with passion and determination. ""Give me the key, I want it!"" she said. ""I wouldn't eat or drink here, even if I had to starve."" CHAPTER XXVII Heathcliff held the key in his hand, which still lay on the table."
"He looked up, astonished by her audacity; perhaps her voice and her gaze reminded him of the person who had given her this gift. She seized the instrument and just managed to pry it from his fingers; but her gesture brought him back to the present; he quickly snatched it back. ""Now, Catherine Linton,"" he said, ""keep your distance, or I'll hit you; and that will make Mrs. Dean furious."" Despite this warning, she once more seized his closed hand and its contents. ""Let's go!"" she repeated, trying to relax her steely muscles; and when she found that her nails left no mark, she set her teeth rather sharply. Heathcliff looked at me, a look that for a moment prevented me from interrupting him."
"Catherine was too engrossed in her fingers to notice his face. He opened them abruptly, giving up the argument; but before she could take them, he seized them with his free hand, placed them over his knee, and with the other delivered a series of terrible blows on both sides of the head, each of which would have been enough to carry out his threat if she had been dropped. Faced with such diabolical violence, I rushed at him in fury. ""You filthy scoundrel!"" I began to scream, ""you filthy scoundrel!"" A touch on the chest silenced me: I am fat and catch my breath fast; and between that and the rage, I staggered back dizzy, close to suffocation or the bursting of a vein. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, freed, placed both hands on her temples, as if she didn't know whether her ears were all right or not."
"She trembled like a reed, the poor creature, and leaned against the table in utter bewilderment. ""I know how to raise children,"" said the villain grimly, bending down to pick up the key that had fallen on the floor. ""Now go to Linton, as I told you, and cry as much as you like! Tomorrow I shall be your father—the father you will have in a few days—and you shall have a pocketful of it. You may have a pocketful of it; you are no weakling: you shall feel the effects every day when I see that devilish anger in your eyes again!"" Cathy rushed to me instead of Linton, knelt down, and laid her burning cheek on my knee, crying her eyes out. Her cousin had crept quietly into a corner of the sofa and was, I dare say, glad that the punishment had fallen on someone other than himself."
"Mr. Heathcliff, seeing how confused we all were, got up and quickly made tea himself. Cups and saucers were ready. He poured the tea and handed me a cup. ""Wash your spleen,"" he said. ""And help your ugly little pet and mine."""
"It's not poisoned, although I prepared it. I'll get your horses."" When he left, our first thought was to force our way out somewhere. We tried the kitchen door, but it was locked from the outside; we looked toward the windows—they were too narrow, even for Cathy's slight figure. ""Master Linton,"" I cried, seeing that we were often locked in, ""you know what your devilish father is up to, and you will tell us, or I will beat you as he beat your cousin."" ""Yes, Linton, you must tell us,"" said Catherine. ""I came for your sake, and it would be terribly ungrateful of you to refuse."" ""Give me some tea, I am thirsty, and then I will tell you,"" he replied. ""Mrs. Dean, go."""
"I don't like it when you lie on top of me. And now, Catherine, let your tears fall into my glass. I won't drink that."
"""Give me another,"" Catherine pushed another toward him and wiped her face. The little brat's coldness disgusted me, for he was no longer afraid of himself. The fear he had shown on the moor had disappeared as soon as he entered Wuthering Heights; so I suspected he was in danger of a terrible tantrum if he failed to lure us there; and once that happened, he was no longer immediately afraid. ""Papa wants us to be married,"" he continued after he had drunk some of the drink. ""And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's afraid I'll die if we wait; so we must be married tomorrow morning, and you must stay here all night; and if you do as he wishes, you can come back the next day and take me away."" ""Go and get married, you poor changeling!"" I cried. ""Do you want to get married? That man is crazy! Or he thinks we're all stupid."""
"And do you think this beautiful young woman, this healthy girl, would care for a dying little monkey like you? Do you think anyone, least of all Miss Catherine Linton, would want you as a husband? You deserve to be whipped for bringing us here with your cowardly wiles: and... don't play dumb! I want to shake you violently for your contemptible treachery and foolish self-importance. I shook him gently, but that set off a coughing fit, and he began to waile and cry again, and Catherine rebuked me. ""Stay all night? No,"" she said, looking around slowly. ""Ellen, I'll burn this door, but I'll get out again."" And she would have carried out her threat immediately, but Linton panicked again. He clutched her with both weak arms and sobbed, ""Won't you take me and save me?"" Won't you let me come to the estate? Oh, dear Catherine! You can't just leave like that. You MUST obey my father, you MUST! ""I must obey my father,"" she replied, ""and free him from this cruel uncertainty."""
"All night! What would he think? He'd be upset already. I'd break in or overexert myself. Be calm! You're not in danger; but if you bother me—Linton, I love Papa more than you! The mortal anguish he felt at Mr. Heathcliff's fury revived the boy's cowardly eloquence."
"Catherine was almost in despair. Nevertheless, she insisted on going home and, in turn, tried to persuade him to end his selfish suffering. Meanwhile, our jailer had returned. ""Your beasts have run away,"" he said, ""and now, Linton! Is he sobbing again? What has she done to you? Come, come, come, lie down. In a month or two, my boy, you can pay her back."""
"You want pure love, don't you? Nothing else in the world: And she'll have you! Off to bed! Zillah won't be here tonight; you must undress. Quiet! Quiet! Once I'm in your room, I won't go near you again: you needn't be afraid. You seem to have done quite well."
"""I'll take care of the rest,"" he said, holding the door open for his son. He climbed out like a spaniel, suspecting the man helping him of plotting something. The lock was locked. Heathcliff went to the fireplace, where my mistress and I remained silent."
"Catherine looked up and instinctively placed her hand on her cheek; the proximity was painful. Anyone else would not have been able to view this childish act with severity, but he stared at her and murmured, ""Oh! Are you not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised: you seem dreadfully frightened!"" ""I am afraid now,"" she answered, ""for if I stay, Papa will be unhappy: and how can I bear to make him unhappy? If he—if he—Mr. Heathcliff, let me go home! I promise to marry Linton: Papa would wish it; and I love him. Why should you force me to do what I naturally love?"" ""Let him dare to force you,"" I cried. ""There is justice in this country, thank God! It exists, even if we are in a lonely place."""
"I'd tell him if he were my own son: and that's a crime beyond the clergy! ""Quiet!"" said the villain. ""To hell with your shouting! I won't let you speak. Miss Linton, the thought of your father being unhappy will amuse me greatly. I won't be able to sleep to calm myself. You couldn't have imagined a better way to live under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than to inform me that something like this was going to happen."""
"As for your promise to marry Linton, I will see that you keep it; for you must not leave this place until you have fulfilled it. ""Then send Ellen to Papa and tell him I am safe!"" cried Catherine, weeping bitterly. ""Or marry me now. Poor Papa! Ellen, he will think we are doomed. What shall we do?"" ""No! He will think you are tired of waiting for him and will run away to amuse yourself a little,"" replied Heathcliff. ""You cannot deny that you came to my house of your own free will, despite his orders to the contrary."""
"And it's only natural that at your age you need entertainment; and that you're tired of caring for a sick man, and that man was only your father. Catherine, his best days were over when yours began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (at least, I did); and it should be normal that he cursed you when he left this world."
"I'd go with him. I don't love you! How could I? Cry. The way I see it, that will be your main occupation in the future; unless Linton makes up for other losses: and your caring parents seem to think so."
"His letters, full of advice and comfort, brought me great joy. In his last letter, he advised my little darling to be gentle with her family and kind to her when he received her. Caring and kind—that is the nature of a father."
"But Linton needs all their attention and kindness. Linton can be a real little bully. He's ready to torture any cat, pull out its teeth, and clip its claws."
"""You'll have wonderful stories to tell his uncle about his kindness when you return, I assure you."" ""You're right!"" I said. ""Explain your son's character to him. Show him how much he resembles you. Then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before taking the basilisk away from him!"" ""I have no qualms about speaking of his lovable qualities now,"" he replied. ""For she must accept it or remain a prisoner, and you with her, until your master dies. I can keep you both here, completely hidden."""
"If you have any doubts, encourage them to recant, and you will have an opportunity to judge! ""I will not recant,"" said Catherine. ""I will marry him at once, if it allows me to go to Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Heathcliff, you are a cruel man, but not a devil; and you will not irretrievably destroy all my happiness by mere malice. If Papa thought I had abandoned him deliberately, and if he were to die before I returned, could I live? I have stopped crying; but I will kneel here beside you; and I will not rise again, nor take my eyes off you, until you look at me again! No, do not turn! LOOK! You will see nothing to provoke you."""
"I don't hate you. I'm not mad that you hit me. You've never loved anyone, Uncle? Never? Ah! You should see this."
"I'm so unhappy you can't help feeling sorry for me. ""Hands off and go away, or I'll kick you!"" cried Heathcliff, pushing her roughly away. ""I'd rather be entwined by a snake. How can you flatter me? I despise you!"" He shrugged his shoulders, shook himself, as if his skin were rising from his heart, and pushed back his chair, while I stood up and opened my mouth to unleash a torrent of insults. But in the middle of the first sentence, I was silenced on the next syllable by the threat of being taken into a room alone."
"It was getting dark; we heard voices at the garden gate. Our host hurried out; he had regained his senses, but we hadn't. We chatted for a few minutes, then he came back alone. ""I thought it was your cousin Hareton,"" I said to Catherine. ""If only he would come! Who knows if he'll come over to us?"" ""Those are three servants sent from the manor to fetch you,"" said Heathcliff, listening at the door. ""You should have opened a gate and called, but I swear this fellow is glad you didn't."""
"She's glad to stay, I'm sure."" CHAPTER XXVII When we learned what a chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief, and he let us weep until nine o'clock. Then he ordered us to go up through the kitchen to Zillah's room, and I whispered to my companion to obey: perhaps we could manage to get in by the window, or into a garret and out by the skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like the one below, and the garret was safe from our attempts, for we were stuck there as before."
"None of us lay down. Catherine took her place by the railing and waited longingly for morning. A deep sigh was the only response I could elicit from her to my constant pleas to rest. I sat in a chair and rocked back and forth, severely assessing my many derelictions of duty. From this, it occurred to me, came all the misadventures of my employers. In reality, this was not the case, I know, but in my imagination, it was that dark night; and I considered Heathcliff himself less guilty than I."
"At seven o'clock he came and asked if Miss Linton had gotten up. She immediately ran to the door and answered, ""Yes."" ""There you are,"" he said, opened the door, and pulled her out. I got up to follow her, but he turned the lock again."
"I demanded my release. ""Be patient,"" he replied, ""I'll bring you breakfast right away."" I knocked on the door and shook the bolt furiously. Catherine asked me why I was still locked up. He replied, ""I must endure another hour,"" and they left. I held out for two or three hours; finally, I heard a step: not Heathcliff's. ""I've brought you food,"" said a voice, ""open the door!"" I obeyed eagerly and saw Hareton, laden with provisions for the whole day. ""Take it,"" he added, pressing the tray into my hand. ""Wait a moment,"" I began. ""No,"" he cried, withdrawing, despite all my entreaties to stop him. And I remained locked there all day, and all the next night; and another, and another."
"I stayed a total of five nights and four days, and every morning I saw no one except Hareton. He was the very image of a jailer: sullen, mute, and deaf to any attempt to influence his sense of justice or his compassion. On the fifth morning, or rather the afternoon, another step approached, lighter and shorter; and this time the figure entered the room. It was Zillah, wrapped in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk hood over her head and a wicker basket on her arm. ""Hey, my dear! Mrs. Dean!"" she exclaimed. ""Why! There's a lecture about you at Gimmerton."""
"I never thought you and Miss would sink with you in Blackhorse Marsh, until Master told me you'd been found and brought back! What? And you had to land on an island, didn't you? And how long were you down there? Did Master rescue you, Mrs. Dean? But you're not that thin, you weren't that sick, were you?' 'Your master's a real scoundrel!' I answered. 'But he'll get even with you. He didn't have to tell the story: it'll all come out in the end!' 'What do you mean?' asked Zillah. 'It's not his story: they tell it in the village, how you were lost in the marsh; and I call out to Earnshaw as I come in: ""Er, strange things have been happening, Mr. Hareton, since I've been gone."" It's a shame about the girl, probably still young, and Nelly Dean.' He stared at me."
"I thought he hadn't heard anything, so I told him the rumor. The master listened, smiled to himself, and said, ""If they were in the swamp, they're out there, Zillah. Nelly Dean is in your room right now."""
"Tell her to run when you come up; here is the key. The swamp water was up to her head, and she would have rushed home; but I helped her until she came to her senses. Tell her, if she is able, to go at once to the manor and deliver a message from me, which her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire's funeral. ""Mr. Edgar is not dead?"" I gasped. ""Oh! Zillah, Zillah!"" ""No, no; sit down, my good lady,"" she answered; ""you are still very ill."""
"He's not dead; Dr. Kenneth thinks he can last another day. I met him on the way and asked him about it. Instead of sitting down, I grabbed my outdoor gear and ran downstairs, since the street was clear. As I entered the house, I looked around for someone who could tell me something about Catherine."
"The room was bathed in sunlight, and the door stood wide open, but no one seemed to be there. As I hesitated whether to leave immediately or return to my mistress, a soft cough drew my attention to the fireplace. Linton lay alone on the sofa, sucking on cotton candy and watching my every move with a dispassionate expression. ""Where is Miss Catherine?"" I asked sternly, hoping to surprise him alone and bring him to his senses."
"He sucked innocently. ""Is she gone?"" I asked. ""No,"" he answered. ""She's upstairs; she mustn't go; we won't let her go."" ""You won't let her go, you idiot!"" I cried. ""Send me to her room at once, or I'll make you sing your heart out."" ""Papa would make you sing your heart out if you tried to leave,"" he answered. ""He says I shouldn't be nice to Catherine; she's my wife, and it's a pity she wants to leave me. He says she hates me and wants to kill me for my money; but she won't, and she'll never come back! She'll never come back! She can cry and vomit all she wants!"" He resumed his usual activities and closed his eyelids as if he were about to fall asleep. ""Master Heathcliff,"" I continued, ""have you forgotten Catherine's kindness last winter, when you declared your love for her, when she brought you books, sang songs for you, and often visited you despite the wind and snow? Chapter 28 She wept one night because you would be disappointed, and you thought then she was a hundred times too good for you. And now you believe your father's lies, even though you know he hates you both. And you ally yourself with him against her."""
"""That's a great gratitude, isn't it?"" Linton's lips drooped, and he took the candy from his lips. ""Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?"" I continued. ""Think for yourself! As for your money, she doesn't even know you're getting it. And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up there in a strange house! You, who know what it is to be neglected like that! You may pity your own sorrow; and her too; but you won't pity hers! I have shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see—an old woman and a lowly servant—and you, after feigning so much affection, and having almost reason to adore her, keep all your tears to yourself and sit quite still. Ah! You are a heartless, selfish wretch!"" ""I cannot stay with her,"" he retorted angrily. ""I will not stay alone."""
"She cries so much that I can't bear it. And she doesn't stop, even when I say I'm calling my father. I called him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she didn't shut up; but as soon as he left the room, she started crying again and moaned all night, while I screamed in rage because I couldn't sleep. ""Isn't Mr. Heathcliff at home?"" I asked, seeing that the unfortunate creature felt no pity for her nephew's mental anguish. ""He's at court,"" he replied, ""speaking to Doctor Kenneth; he says his uncle is really dying."""
"I'm happy because after him, I'll be the mistress of the Grange. Catherine always called it her home. It's not hers! It's mine: Papa says everything she owns is mine."
"All her beautiful books belong to me. She offered to give them to me, along with her pretty birds and her pony Minny, if I took the key to our room from her and let them out. But I told her she had nothing to give, they were all mine. Then she started to cry, took out a small picture she wore around her neck, and said I could have it. Two pictures in a little gold box, one of her mother and one of her uncle when they were little. That was yesterday. I said they were mine too, and tried to take them away from her."
"The cruel creature wouldn't let me go; she pushed me away and hurt me. I screamed—it frightened her—when she heard Papa coming, broke the hinges, snapped the suitcase in half, and handed me her mother's portrait. She tried to hide the other one, but Papa asked me what was wrong, and I explained. He took the portrait from me and ordered her to give me hers. She refused, and he—he pushed her over, tore it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot. ""And you agreed to her being beaten?"" I asked, to encourage him. ""I winked,"" he replied. ""I wink when I see my father beat a dog or a horse; he does it so brutally."""
"At first I was glad: she deserved the punishment for pushing me. But when Dad was gone, she took me to the window and showed me the cut on the inside of her cheek where her teeth had been, and her mouth full of blood. Then she picked up the picture pieces, sat down facing the wall, and hasn't spoken to me since. And sometimes I think she can't speak for the pain. I don't like that thought; but she's a horrible creature, crying all the time; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid for her. ""And can you have the key if you want?"" I said. ""Yes, when I get upstairs,"" he replied. ""But I can't go up now."" ""Which apartment is it in?"" I asked. ""Oh,"" he cried, ""I won't tell you where it is. It's our secret."""
"No one, neither Hareton nor Zillah, was allowed to know. ""Look! You've completely exhausted me, go away, go away!"" And he turned his head toward his arm and closed his eyes again. CHAPTER XXVIII I thought it best to go away without seeing Mr. Heathcliff and try to rescue my young wife from the Grange."
"Upon their arrival, my colleagues were overjoyed and thrilled to see me. When they learned that their little mistress was well, two or three rushed to Mr. Edgar's door to tell him the news; but I broke the news myself. How much he seemed to have changed in just a few days! Sad and resigned, he lay there, waiting for death. He looked very young: although he was thirty-nine, you would have thought he was at least ten years younger."
"He was thinking of Catherine, for he whispered her name. I touched his hand and spoke. ""Catherine is coming, dear sir!"" I murmured. ""She is well and hearty; I hope she will come this evening."" I trembled at the first news; he half rose, looked around the apartment, and then fell back, dazed. As soon as he came to, I told him about our obligatory visit and our imprisonment in the Heights."
"I said Heathcliff had forced me to go in, which wasn't entirely true. I told Linton as little as possible about this, nor did I describe his father's brutality; my intention was, if possible, not to aggravate his already overflowing grief. He suspected that his enemy intended to bequeath the personal property and possessions to his son, or rather to himself; but why he hadn't waited until his death remained a mystery to my master, for he didn't know how close he and his nephew would become."
"However, he felt his will could be better amended: instead of leaving Catherine's estate to herself, he decided to leave it to trustees for her to dispose of during her lifetime and for her children, if any came after her. Thus, in the event of Linton's death, the estate could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff. After receiving his instructions, I sent a man to fetch the lawyer and four other men equipped with serviceable weapons to requisition my young wife from her jailer."
"Both parties were kept waiting until late into the night. The only servant returned first. He announced that Mr. Green, the lawyer, would be out when he arrived and would have to wait two hours for his return. Mr. Green then informed him that he had some business in the village but would arrive at Thrushcross Grange before morning."
"The four men also returned alone. They announced that Catherine was ill; too ill to leave her room; and Heathcliff wouldn't allow them to visit her. I gave these fools a good dressing down for listening to this story, which I refused to tell my master. I decided to go to the high ground with a whole party in broad daylight and attack them head-on, unless we could discreetly surrender ourselves to the prisoners."
"Her father will see her, I swore again and again, if that devil dies at her door trying to stop her! Fortunately, I was spared the trip and the trouble. I had gone downstairs at three o'clock to fetch a pitcher of water and was crossing the hall with it when a sharp knock at the front door startled me. ""Oh! It's Green,"" I said, and stopped again—""Only Green,"" and moved on, intending to send someone else to open it; but the knock came again: not loud, but urgent. I placed the pitcher on the banister and hurried to let him in myself."
"Outside, the full moon shone brightly. It wasn't the lawyer. My dear little mistress threw herself sobbing on my neck: ""Ellen, Ellen! Is Papa still alive?"" ""Yes,"" I cried, ""yes, my little angel, he is! Thank God you're safe with us again!"" Panting, she tried to climb the stairs to Mr. Linton's room, but I made her sit down, gave her something to drink, and washed her pale face, rubbing it with my apron to make it white."
"I then told her I had to go first and tell her of his arrival; I asked her to tell me that she would be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared at me fixedly, but soon understood why I had told her this lie and assured me that she would not complain. I couldn't bear to be present at her meeting."
"I stood at the bedroom door for fifteen minutes, hardly daring to approach the bed. But all was quiet: Catherine's despair was as unobtrusive as her father's joy. She seemed to be calmly supporting him; and he stared into her face, his eyes raised to heaven, wide with ecstasy."
"He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood; he died like this. He kissed her cheek and murmured, ""I will go to her; and you, my dear child, come to us!"" He moved no more, spoke no more; but he retained that rapturous, radiant look until his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul left him. No one could discern the exact moment of his death, so completely without struggle."
"Whether Catherine shed tears or her grief was too great to allow them to flow, she sat with dry eyes until sunrise. She remained there until noon and would still have been brooding on her deathbed if I had not insisted that she leave and rest. Fortunately, I managed to get her away, for around noon the lawyer who had come to Wuthering Heights to receive his instructions appeared. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff; that was why he had waited so long before answering my master's summons."
"Fortunately, after his daughter's arrival, he no longer had any material worries. Mr. Green took it upon himself to put the house in order. He asked all the servants, except me, to leave."
"He is said to have abused his delegated authority to such an extent that he demanded that Edgar Linton be buried not next to his wife, but in the chapel with his family. However, this was prevented, and I vehemently protested against any violation of the regulations. The funeral was rushed; Catherine, now Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, was allowed to remain at the Grange until her father's death."
She told me that her fear had finally driven Linton to risk his release. She had heard the men I had sent to the gate arguing and understood Heathcliff's reaction. She was desperate.
"Linton, who had been shown into the living room shortly after my departure, was terrified and wanted the key back before his father returned. He was clever enough to open and lock the door without closing it. And when he was supposed to be going to bed, he asked Hareton to sleep with him, and this time his request was granted. Catherine sneaked out before daybreak."
"She didn't dare open the doors for fear the dogs might raise the alarm. She visited the empty rooms and inspected the windows. Landing happily in her mother's room, she effortlessly climbed over the railing and climbed down through the neighboring fir tree. Her accomplice, despite his timid cunning, suffered for his involvement in the escape. The evening after the funeral, my young wife and I sat in the library, sometimes sad—one of us even despairing—reflecting on our loss, sometimes hypothesizing about a bleak future."
"We had just agreed that Catherine's best fate would be to be allowed to remain at the Grange, at least as long as Linton lived: he could come to her, and I could stay on as governess. This arrangement seemed too advantageous to hope for; and yet I hoped, and began to rejoice at the prospect of keeping my house, my position, and above all, my beloved young mistress. Then a servant—one of the servants who had come out and had not yet left—rushed across the yard crying, ""That confounded Heathcliff!"" Was he going to slam the door in her face? Had we been foolish enough to order him, we would not have had time. He did not bother to knock or give his name: he was the master and was exercising his right to enter without a word."
"Our informant's voice led him to the library; he entered, beckoned her out, and closed the door. It was the same room he had been greeted in eighteen years earlier: the same moon shone through the window, and the same autumn landscape stretched outside. We hadn't lit a candle yet, but the entire apartment was visible, even the portraits on the wall: the magnificent portrait of Mrs. Linton and the enchanting portrait of her husband."
"Heathcliff walked to the fireplace. His appearance, too, had changed little over time. He was still the same man: his dark face was a little paler and calmer, his figure perhaps a few pounds heavier, nothing more."
"Catherine had stood up, overcome by an urgent desire to run away when she saw him. ""Stop!"" he said, grabbing her arm. ""Don't run away again! Where are you going? I'll come for you; I hope you're a respectful girl and won't encourage my son to further disobedience. I was ashamed of the punishment I had to inflict on him when I discovered his involvement in this affair: he's such a cobweb that a little tweak would destroy him; but you can see from the look on his face that he got what he deserved! One evening, the day before yesterday, I took him downstairs and simply sat him down on a chair. I haven't touched him since. I sent Hareton away, and we had the room to ourselves."""
"Two hours later, I called Joseph to carry him back upstairs. Since then, my presence has bothered him like a ghost. I suspect he sees me often, even when I'm not there. Hareton says he wakes up every night, howling, and calls you to protect him from me. Whether you love your dear companion or not, you must come. He is now in your care. I entrust my entire interest in him to you. ""Why don't you let Catherine stay here?"" I begged, ""and send Master Linton to her? Since you hate them both, you won't miss them. They can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart."" ""I seek a lodger for the Grange,"" he replied. ""And I want my children near me, that's for sure. Besides, this young lady owes me her services for her bread."""
"I will not raise him in luxury and idleness when Linton is gone. So, prepare yourself quickly and do not force me to force you. ""I will,"" said Catherine. ""Linton is all I love now, and though you have done all you can to make him hate me and I hate him, you cannot make us hate each other. And I dare you to hurt him when I am near, and I dare you to frighten me!"" ""You are a boastful fighter,"" replied Heathcliff, ""but I do not love you enough to hurt him: you will taste the torment to the fullest while it lasts."""
"It is not I who makes him so hateful in your eyes, but his own kindness. He is bitter as gall because of your abandonment and its consequences: expect no thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him paint a beautiful picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as I am: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his mind to find a substitute for strength. ""I know he has a bad temper,"" said Catherine, ""he is your son."""
"But I am glad to have a better one, one who forgives me; and I know he loves me, and therefore I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, you have NO ONE who loves you; and however unhappy you make us, we shall always revenge ourselves with the thought that your cruelty springs from your greater misery. You are unhappy, are you not? Lonely as the devil and jealous as he? NO ONE loves you. NO ONE will weep for you when you die! I would not be you! Catherine spoke with a sort of gloomy triumph: she seemed determined to adapt herself to the spirit of her future family and to revel in the grief of her enemies. ""You will be sorry,"" said her father-in-law, ""if you stay there a minute longer."""
"""Go away, witch, and pack your things!"" She stepped back contemptuously. In his absence, I began to beg for Zillah's place on the hills and offered him mine; but he refused, regardless of the circumstances. He ordered me to be silent; then, for the first time, he allowed himself to look around the room and observe the paintings."
"After examining Mrs. Linton's grave, he said, ""I want this house. Not because I need it, but—"" He turned abruptly toward the fire and continued with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile: ""I'll tell you what I did yesterday! I asked the sexton who was digging Linton's grave to take the earth off the coffin lid, and I opened it. For a while, I thought I had stayed in it. When I saw his face again—it's still his!—he must have taken some pains to wake me. But he said it would change when the wind blew over it, so I tore off one side of the coffin and covered it up: not Linton's, for heaven's sake! I wish it had been soldered with lead."""
"And I bribed the sexton to put it away while I'm lying there, and to put mine away too; I'll have them do that: and when Linton comes, he won't know what's the matter!' 'You've been very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I cried; 'weren't you ashamed to disturb the dead?' 'I didn't disturb anyone, Nelly,' he answered; 'and I've taken a little rest. I'll be much better now, and you'll have a better chance of keeping me underground when I get there. Disturbed you? No! She disturbed me, day and night, for eighteen years, without ceasing, without pause, until last night; and last night I was quiet.'"
"I dreamed I was sleeping the last sleep of this sleeper, my heart still and my cheek frozen against hers. ""And if she had dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamed of?"" I asked. ""Dissolving with her and being even happier!"" he replied. ""Do you think I'm afraid of such a change? I expected such a transformation when I lifted the lid, but I'm glad it only begins when I share it. Besides, this strange feeling would hardly have disappeared if I hadn't had a distinct impression of her expressionless features. It began strangely."""
"You know, I went mad after her death and begged her endlessly, from sunrise to sunset, to give me back her spirit! I firmly believe in ghosts: I'm convinced they can live among us! On the day of her funeral, there was a blizzard. In the evening, I went to the cemetery. The wind was cold, like winter; one felt lonely everywhere."
"I wasn't afraid that her foolish husband would arrive in the valley so late; and no one else was allowed to take her there. Alone, and aware that two meters of soft earth formed the only barrier between us, I said to myself, ""I'll take her in my arms again! If she's cold, I think it's the north wind chilling me; and if she's quiet, she's asleep."" I grabbed a shovel from the tool shed and began digging with all my might: It scraped the coffin; I began working with my hands; the wood began to creak around the screws; I was almost there when I thought I heard someone sigh, bending over at the edge of the grave. ""If only I could get this off,"" I murmured, ""if only they would cover us both with earth!"" and I pulled with even more force. Another sigh sounded close to my ear."
"I thought I felt her warm breath dispelling the icy wind. I knew there was no living creature nearby; but as surely as one senses the approach of a large body in the darkness, even if it's barely visible, I sensed Cathy's presence: not beneath me, but on the ground. Sudden relief swept through me."
"I gave up my pain and immediately turned around, comforted—unspeakably comforted. Her presence was with me: she stayed while I filled the grave and carried me home. You can laugh if you want, but I was sure I saw her there."
"I was sure she was with me and couldn't resist talking to her. When I arrived at the Heights, I eagerly ran to the door. It was locked; and I still remember that damned Earnshaw and my wife resisting me."
"I remember pausing to let him die, then running up the stairs to my room and hers. I looked around impatiently—I felt her beside me—I could almost have seen her, and yet I couldn't! I would have sweated with desire—with pleading for a single glance! I didn't get one. She proved, as so often in her life, to be a demon to me! And since then, sometimes more, sometimes less, I have been the target of this unbearable torture! Infernal! My nerves were so frayed that, had they not been like cat intestines, they would long ago have been as weak as Linton."
"When I was in the house with Hareton, it seemed to me as if I were crossing it on my way out; when I crossed the moor, I met her on my way in. When I left the house, I came back hurriedly; she must be somewhere on the Downs, I was sure of it! And when I slept in her room, I was quite unconscious. I couldn't lie down; as soon as I closed my eyes, she was either out, opening the shutters, coming into the room, or laying her favorite head on the same pillow as when she was a child; and I had to open my eyes to see anything."
"And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night, only to be disappointed again and again! It tormented me! I often groaned aloud, until that old scoundrel Joseph doubtless thought my conscience was playing tricks on me. Now, since I've seen it, I'm somewhat calmer. It was a strange way of killing: not in small steps, but with fragments of hair, to entice me with the specter of a hope that had lasted eighteen years! Mr. Heathcliff stopped and mopped his brow; his hair was sticky there, damp with perspiration; his gaze was fixed on the red embers of the fire, his brows were not frowned but raised at the temples; which, while concealing the gloom of his face, gave it a strange expression of anxiety and the painful appearance of mental tension directed upon a single, all-absorbing theme."
"He spoke to me only half-heartedly, and I remained silent. I did not like listening to him! After a while, he returned his attention to the picture, took it down, and leaned it against the bench to examine it more closely. While he was thus absorbed, Catherine came in and announced that she would be ready as soon as her pony was saddled. ""Send it tomorrow,"" said Heathcliff; then, turning to her, he added, ""You can do without your pony: the weather is fine, and you will not need it at Wuthering Heights; no matter how far you go, your own feet will be enough. Come."" ""Goodbye, Ellen!"" whispered my dear little mistress."
"When she kissed me, her lips were cold. ""Come and see, Ellen; don't forget that."" ""Don't, Mrs. Dean!"" said her new father. ""If I want to talk to you, I'll come. I don't want you to look at me!"" He gestured for her to go ahead; and with a look that touched me deeply, she obeyed. I watched them through the window as they crossed the garden."
"Heathcliff took Catherine's arm through his, despite her initial protests, and led her briskly into the driveway, where the trees concealed her. ""I visited the Heights, but I haven't seen her since she left."" Joseph held the door open for me with one hand when I asked and wouldn't let me through. He said Mrs. Linton was ""busy"" and the master wasn't there."
"Zillah explained to me how they operate; otherwise, I would hardly know who is dead and who is alive. She finds Catherine haughty and dislikes her, I can tell by the way she speaks. My young wife asked her for help immediately upon her arrival; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to mind her own business and let her daughter-in-law manage on her own; and Zillah, a narrow-minded and selfish woman, agreed without hesitation."
"Catherine was childishly annoyed at this neglect; she paid the price with her contempt, and numbered my informant among her enemies as surely as if she had done her a grave wrong. About six weeks ago, shortly before your arrival, I had a long talk with Zillah at our meeting on the Moor, and this is what she told me: ""The first thing Mrs. Linton did,"" she told me, ""on arriving at the Heights, was to rush upstairs without even saying good night to Joseph and me; she locked herself in Linton's room and remained there until morning. Then, while Mr. and Earnshaw were breakfasting, she went into the house and, with trembling hands, asked everyone if it would be possible to send for the doctor. Her nephew was gravely ill. ""We know it!"" replied Heathcliff, ""but his life isn't worth a penny, and I won't spend a penny for him."" ""But I can't tell you how to do it,"" she said; ""And if no one helps me, he'll die!"" ""Get out of this room,"" cried the gentleman, ""and I never want to hear of him again! No one here cares what happens to him. If they do, play nurse. If not, lock him up and leave him alone."" ""Then she began to pester me, and I told her I was tired of this miserable situation. We both had our duties, and she should be waiting on Linton. Mr. Heathcliff said I left her to deal with it alone. How they managed it together, I cannot say."""
"I think he was terribly angry and moaned day and night; and she hardly got any rest: you could see it in her pale face and heavy eyes. Sometimes she came into the kitchen, quite haggard, with her face as if she were begging for help; but I was obedient to the master: I would never dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and although I thought it wrong that Kenneth was not called, it was not my place to advise or complain, and I always refused to interfere. Once or twice after we had gone to bed, I happened to open the door again and saw her sitting at the top of the stairs, crying; so I quickly locked myself in the house, for fear of interfering."
"I certainly felt sorry for her at the time, but I didn't want to lose my place. Finally, one night, she came into my room in a rage and frightened me by saying, 'Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying—this time I know. Get up at once and tell him.'"" After this speech, she disappeared again. I lay there for a quarter of an hour, listening and trembling."
"Nothing moved; the house was silent. ""She's mistaken,"" I told myself. ""He's crossed the line. I don't need to disturb her,"" and I began to doze off."
"But my sleep was disturbed a second time by a loud bell—the only one we have, hung especially for Linton. The master called me to see what was going on and to tell them he didn't want to hear that noise again. ""I've delivered Catherine's message."" He cursed himself and a few minutes later went into her room with a lit candle. I followed him."
"Mrs. Heathcliff sat by the bed with clasped hands. Her father-in-law stepped forward, held the lamp before Linton's face, looked at it, and touched it; then he turned to her. ""Well, Catherine,"" he said, ""how do you feel?"" ""She was dumb."" ""How do you feel, Catherine?"" he repeated. ""He is safe, and I am free,"" she replied. ""I should be well, but,"" she continued with undisguised bitterness, ""you have left me to struggle with death alone for so long that I see and feel nothing but death! I feel like death!"" ""And she looked like it! I gave her wine."" Hareton and Joseph, who had been awakened by footsteps and had heard our conversation outside, came in."
"Joseph, I think, was glad the boy was gone; Hareton seemed worried, though he was more occupied in staring at Catherine than thinking about Linton. But the Lord bade him go back to bed: we didn't need his help. Later, he had Joseph carry the body into his room and told me to return to mine and leave Mrs. Heathcliff alone. The next morning, he sent me to tell her to come down to breakfast: she had undressed and seemed to be asleep, pretending to be ill; which didn't much surprise me."
"I asked Mr. Heathcliff, and he said, ""Well, leave her alone until after the funeral. Go up now and then and get her what she needs. And as soon as she's better, let me know."" According to Zillah, Cathy stayed upstairs for two weeks; she visited him twice a day and would have been kinder, but her attempts to make her kinder were proudly and promptly rebuffed. Heathcliff once went up to show her Linton's will. He had left everything he owned and everything she had been to her father; the poor man was threatened or persuaded to do so during his week's absence after his uncle's death."
"He wasn't allowed to interfere with the lands belonging to the miners. Mr. Heathcliff, however, claimed them and kept them in his wife's and his own possession. I suppose that's legal; Catherine, who has neither money nor friends, certainly can't interfere with his property. ""No one,"" said Zillah, ""ever knocked at her door except that one time, except me; and no one asked for her. The first time she came into the house was on a Sunday afternoon."""
"She had cried out when I brought her supper upstairs that she could no longer bear the cold; I had told her the Lord was going to Thrushcross Grange and Earnshaw, and I needn't stop her from coming down. As soon as she heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she appeared, dressed in black, her blond curls tucked behind her ears as distinctly as a Quaker's; she couldn't comb them. ""Joseph and I usually go to chapel on Sundays,"" Mrs. Dean explained. ""The church, as you know, has no minister these days; and the Methodist or Baptist chapel (I forget which) in Gimmerton is called a chapel."" ""Joseph was away,"" she continued, ""but I thought it best to stay home. Young people always fare better in the care of an elder; and Hareton, despite his shyness, is no model of good manners. I informed him that his cousin would probably be coming along and that she still felt strongly about the observance of the Sabbath. Therefore, it was best if he left his weapons and other chores there."
"He blushed at this news and glanced over his hands and clothes. The oil and gunpowder had disappeared in a flash. I saw that he wanted to keep her company; and from his demeanor, I concluded that he wanted to present himself well. Laughing—for I dare not laugh when the Lord is near—I offered him my help, if he wanted it, and mocked his distress."
"He frowned and began to curse. ""Mrs. Dean,"" Zillah continued, seeing that I disliked her behavior, ""you may think your young wife too beautiful for Mr. Hareton; and you are right; but I confess I should like to temper her pride a little. And what is all her education and refinement worth to her now? She is as poor as you and I; poorer, I should say, and I always do my best."" Hareton allowed Zillah to help him; and she flattered him good-naturedly; and when Catherine arrived, half-forgetting her previous insults, he had tried, as the housekeeper reported, to make himself amiable. ""Miss came in,"" she said, ""cold as an icicle and as tall as a princess. I stood up and offered her my place in the armchair."""
"No, she rolled her eyes at my politeness. Earnshaw also stood up and ordered her to sit on the sofa by the fire: he was sure she was starving. ""I've been starving for a month or more,"" she replied, using the word with utter contempt. ""And she took a chair and placed it some distance away from the two of us. After sitting down until she was warm, she looked around and spotted some books on the dresser. She immediately jumped up and grabbed them, but they were too high."""
"Her cousin, who had been watching her for some time, finally plucked up the courage to help her. She held his dress, and he filled it with the first object he found. ""That was a big step forward for the boy."" She didn't thank him; but he felt flattered that she had accepted his help and dared to stand behind her while she looked at the pictures. He even leaned forward to show her what she liked about some of the old pictures. Even the brutality with which she ripped the page from his fingers didn't discourage him: he simply stepped back a little and looked at her instead of reading the book. She continued reading or looked for something to read."
"His attention gradually became focused on the study of her thick, silky curls: he couldn't see her face, and she couldn't see him. And, perhaps not yet quite aware of what he was doing, but attracted like a child to a candle, he finally passed from looking to touching; he reached out and stroked her curls as gently as a bird's. He could have stung her neck; she shuddered. ""Go away now! How dare you touch me? Why are you standing there?"" she cried in disgust. ""I can't stand you! I'll come again if you come any closer."" Mr. Hareton backed away as stupidly as he could: he sat motionless on the sofa, and she leafed through her books for another half hour. Finally, Earnshaw came up to me and whispered: ""Will you ask him to read to us, Zillah? I'm all for idleness; and I like him—I'd like to hear him!"" I'm not saying I wanted to, but ask yourself. ""Mr. Hareton would like you to read to us, Madam,"" I said at once. ""He would find that very kind and greatly appreciate it."" She frowned, looked up, and replied, ""Mr. Hareton and all of you, be so kind as to understand that I reject any semblance of kindness you so hypocritically display! I despise you and have nothing to say to you! Although I would have given my life for a single kind word, if only to see one from you, you have all stayed away."""
"But I won't complain to you! It's the cold that brings me here, not to entertain you or enjoy your company. ""What could I have done?"" began Earnshaw. ""How can I be blamed?"" ""Oh! You are an exception,"" replied Mrs. Heathcliff. ""I have never been so lacking in solicitude as you."" ""But I have suggested and asked for it more than once,"" he said, provoking her boldness. ""I have asked Mr. Heathcliff to look after you—"" ""Hold your tongue! I would rather go out or anywhere than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!"" said my lady. ""Hareton whispered she would go to the devil for him!"" and he renounced his Sunday duties and threw away his gun. Then he spoke freely; and she soon thought it best to retire to her solitude; but the cold had set in, and in spite of her pride, she was compelled to degrade herself more and more in our company. However, I have taken care that my good nature is no longer despised. Since then, I have been as rigid as she is. She has neither a lover nor a lover among us, nor does she deserve one. For if the slightest word is spoken to her, she recoils without respect for anyone."
"She will attack the master himself and force him to strike her as often as he dares; and the more she is hurt, the more venomous she will become."" When I heard this story from Zillah, my first decision was to give up my position, take a cottage, and ask Catherine to live with me; but Mr. Heathcliff would accept her as well as Hareton in another house; and at present I see no solution unless she remarries; and that plan is not in my power. Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story. In spite of the doctor's predictions, I am recovering rapidly, and although it is only the second week of January, I intend to set out on horseback in a day or two and go to Wuthering Heights to inform my landlord that I shall be spending the next six months in London;"
"I wouldn't spend another winter here. Yesterday the sky was clear, calm, and icy. I went to the Heights as planned: My housekeeper asked me to deliver a message from her to her young wife, and I didn't refuse, for the worthy lady found nothing unusual in her request."
"The front door was open, but the enviable gate was locked, as it had been on my last visit. I knocked and called Earnshaw from the flowerbeds; he unchained the chain, and I entered. He is an attractive man, an irresistibly attractive farmer. This time I paid him special attention, but apparently he's doing his best to minimize his advantages."
"I asked if Mr. Heathcliff was at home. He replied, ""No, but he would be here around dinnertime."" It was eleven o'clock, and I announced that I would wait for him inside. He immediately put down his tools and accompanied me, as a watchdog, not as a deputy. We went in together; Catherine was there, making herself useful by preparing vegetables for the upcoming meal; she looked grumpier and less energetic than when I first met her."
"She hardly gave me a glance and applied herself to her work with the same contempt for everyday courtesies as before; she did not return my greeting or ""good morning"" with the slightest greeting. ""She does not look as friendly,"" I thought, ""as Mrs. Dean would have me believe. She is a beauty, but she is no angel."" Earnshaw harshly ordered her to fetch her things from the kitchen. ""She must fetch you herself,"" she said, pushing them away as soon as she had finished. Then she sank onto a stool by the window and began carving birds and animals out of the turnips that lay in her lap. I went over to her and pretended to glance into the garden. As it seemed to me, I deftly placed Mrs. Dean's letter on her lap without Hareton noticing. But she asked aloud, ""What is it?"" and threw it away. ""A letter from an old acquaintance, the housekeeper of the Grange,"" I answered. I was annoyed that she betrayed my kind gesture, and I was afraid that people would think it was a letter from me."
"She would have liked this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized it and put it in his waistcoat, remarking that Mr. Heathcliff must first examine it. Catherine then turned away from us in silence, furtively drew out her handkerchief, and placed it before her eyes; and her cousin, struggling for a moment with tender feelings, produced the letter and flung it on the ground beside her as spitefully as possible. Catherine took it and read it eagerly; then she asked me a few questions about the inhabitants of her old house, the sensible and the unreasonable; and, looking at the hills, she murmured in a monologue: ""I wish I could take Minny there! I wish I could climb them! Oh! I am tired, I am stuck, Hareton!"" And she leaned her beautiful head against the windowsill, half yawning, half sighing, and assumed an absent and sad attitude: she didn't care whether we were talking about her, or she knew it. ""Mrs. Heathcliff,"" I said, after sitting a while, ""don't you know that I'm an acquaintance of yours? So familiar that I find it strange that you don't speak to me."""
"My housekeeper never tires of talking about you and praising you. She will be very disappointed when I return and hear nothing from you except that you received her letter and have said nothing! She seemed surprised by this talk and asked, ""Does Ellen love you?"" ""Yes, very much,"" I answered hesitantly. ""You must tell her,"" she continued, ""that I would answer her letter, but I have nothing to write with: not even a book from which I could tear a page."" ""No books!"" I cried. ""How do you manage to live here without them? If I may ask so freely. Although I have a large library, I am often bored at the Grange. If you took my books away from me, I would despair!"" ""I always read when I had them,"" said Catherine. ""And Mr. Heathcliff never reads. That's why he's taken it into his head to destroy my books. I haven't seen them for weeks."""
"Only once did I search Joseph's theological collection, much to his chagrin; and once, Hareton, I came across a secret hiding place in your room: Latin and Greek, histories and poems: such old friends. I brought the latter here, and you have gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the sheer love of stealing! They are of no use to you; or you have hidden them in the evil mind that, since you can derive no benefit from them, no one else can. Perhaps your envy drove Mr. Heathcliff to steal my treasures? But I have written most of them down in my head and engraved them on my heart, and you cannot take them away from me! Earnshaw blushed at this revelation of his private literary collections and stammered an indignant refutation of their accusations. ""Mr. Hareton is eager to expand his knowledge,"" I said to his relief. ""He does not envy you, but appreciates your achievements."""
"In a few years, he'll be a brilliant student. ""And until then, he wants me to be an idiot,"" Catherine replied. ""Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read aloud, and he's making terrible mistakes! I wish you would imitate Chevy Chase like you did yesterday: it was awfully funny. I heard you; and I heard you looking up the difficult words in the dictionary and then cursing because you couldn't read the explanations!"" The young man was obviously annoyed at being laughed at for his ignorance and then ridiculed for trying to correct it. I had a similar idea, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote about her first attempt to shed light on the darkness in which he had been raised, and remarked, ""But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have all graduated and have all stumbled and staggered over the threshold before; if our teachers had scorned us instead of helping us, we would still be stumbling and staggering."" ""Oh!"" she replied, ""I do not wish to limit his knowledge, but he has no right to appropriate mine and ridicule me with his abominable errors and mispronunciations! These books, both in prose and poetry, were assigned to me by other societies, and I cannot bear to see them vilified and desecrated in his mouth! Moreover, as if out of conscious malice, he has chosen above all my favorite pieces, which I most like to repeat."" Hareton's chest rose and fell silently for a moment: he suffered from a violent feeling of humiliation and anger that he could not easily suppress."
"I rose to politely dismiss him, sat down in the doorway, and contemplated the view. He followed my example and left the room, but soon returned with half a dozen books in his hand, which he flung into Catherine's lap, exclaiming: ""Take them! I never want to hear of them, read them, or think of them again!"" ""I don't want them now,"" she replied. ""I shall associate them with you, and hate them."" She opened one, which she had evidently turned over several times, and read aloud a passage in the drawling voice of a debutante; then she laughed and threw it away. ""And listen,"" she continued provocatively, beginning in the same tone a verse of an old ballad. But her self-esteem could bear no further torment: I heard, without absolute disapproval, a bold hand pass over her spiteful tongue."
"The little girl had done everything she could to hurt her niece's delicate, yet uncultured, feelings, and a physical confrontation was the only way to settle the score and take revenge on the perpetrator. Then he took the books and threw them into the fire. I could see in his face how painful this sacrifice was for the spleen."
"I imagined him, as we ate, recalling the pleasure they had already given him, the triumph and ever-increasing bliss he had expected; and I also fancied I could guess what drove him to his secret studies. He had been content with daily work and raw, animal pleasures until Catherine crossed his path. The shame of her contempt and the hope of her approval were his first impulses to higher aims; and instead of protecting him from the one and winning him to the other, his efforts to elevate himself had the exact opposite effect. ""Ay, that's all an animal like you can get!"" cried Catherine, sucking her injured lip and watching the burn with indignant eyes. ""You'd better keep quiet,"" he retorted sharply."
"His excitement prevented him from continuing the conversation; he hurried to the entrance, where I let him pass. But before he had even passed through the door, Mr. Heathcliff came up the causeway, seized him by the shoulder, and asked, ""What now, my boy?"" ""Nothing, nothing,"" he said, and went away to indulge his grief and anger in solitude. Heathcliff watched him and sighed. ""It would be strange if I were to thwart myself,"" he murmured, not noticing that I was standing behind him. ""But when I look for her father in his face, I see her more and more every day! How can he be so like her? I can hardly bear to look at him."" He lowered his eyes and entered gloomily."
"His face was worried and troubled. I had never mentioned him before; and in person, he seemed much more frugal. His daughter-in-law saw him at the window and immediately ran into the kitchen. I was left alone. ""I'm glad to see you again, Mr. Lockwood,"" he said in response to my greeting. ""Partly for selfish reasons: I don't think I can easily compensate for your loss in this desolation."""
"I have often wondered what brings you here. ""A caprice, I fear, sir,"" I replied; ""or a caprice will carry me away. I am going to London next week, and I must warn you that I do not intend to keep Thrushcross Grange longer than the twelve months I have agreed to rent it for. I do not think I shall live there much longer."" ""Oh, indeed; you are tired of being banished from the world, are you not?"" he said. ""But if you come to beg for a place you will not inhabit, your journey is useless: I will never be dissuaded from demanding my rights from anyone."" ""I came to beg for nothing,"" I cried, rather crossly. ""If you wish, I will come to an agreement with you now,"" and took my notebook from my pocket. ""No, no,"" he replied coldly; ""you will leave enough to pay your debts if you do not return."" I'm not in such a hurry."
"Sit down and dine with us; a guest who is unlikely to return is usually welcome. Catherine, bring in the provisions: where are you? Catherine appeared with a tray full of knives and forks. ""You can dine with Joseph,"" Heathcliff murmured off to the side, ""and stay in the kitchen until he leaves."" She followed his instructions to the letter: perhaps she would not be tempted to sin. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably couldn't appreciate anyone from a better social class if she met them."
"With the gloomy, gloomy Mr. Heathcliff on one side and the silent Hareton on the other, I prepared a rather gloomy supper and took my leave early. I had intended to leave by the back door to catch a last glimpse of Catherine and to tease old Joseph; but Hareton was instructed to lead my horse, and my host personally escorted me to the door, so my wish could not be fulfilled. ""How dull life is in this house!"" I thought, as I walked down the street. ""How romantic it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff if we had entered into a relationship as her kind nurse had desired, and settled down together in the lively atmosphere of the town!"" 1802. — Last September I was invited to roam the moors of a friend in the north, and on my way to his lodgings I unexpectedly found myself 15 miles from Gimmerton. The stable boy at an inn was holding a bucket of water to refresh my horses when a cart loaded with freshly harvested, very green oats passed by. He remarked, ""We're not from Gimmerton! They're only three shades behind the others with their harvest."" ""Gimmerton?"" I repeated. My stay in this area had already become vague and dreamy. ""Ah! I know."""
"""How far is it from here?"" ""It's fourteen miles into the mountains, and the road is bad,"" he replied. I was suddenly overcome by a desire to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was barely midday, and I thought I might as well spend the night at home as at an inn."
"Besides, I could easily take a day to settle my affairs with my landlord, thus saving myself the trouble of returning to the area. After a short rest, I asked my servant to inquire about the way to the village. Much to the exhaustion of our animals, we covered the distance in about three hours. I left him there and continued up the valley alone."
"The gray church looked even grayer, and the lonely cemetery even more so. I saw a Heidschnucke sheep grazing on the short grass of the graves. It was mild and warm—too hot to travel; but the heat didn't stop me from admiring the beautiful landscape from above and below. Had I seen it in August, I would surely have longed for a month of solitude."
"Nothing is darker in winter, nothing more heavenly in summer than these hill-fringed valleys and these rugged, wild moors. I arrived at the Grange before sunset and knocked for entry; but, judging by the thin blue wreath winding around the kitchen chimney, the family had retired to the back of the house and heard nothing. I went out into the courtyard."
"On the porch sat a little girl of nine or ten knitting, and an old woman lay on the steps, musing over her pipe. ""Is Mrs. Dean here?"" I asked the lady. ""Mrs. Dean? No!"" she answered, ""she doesn't live here, she's in the Heights."" ""Then you're the housekeeper?"" I continued. ""Well, keep the house clean,"" she replied. ""Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms I can stay in? I want to stay all night."" ""The master!"" she cried in surprise. ""Who knew you were coming? They must have sent a message. You can't find a dry or inexperienced person anywhere; there's nothing here!"" She threw away her pipe and hurried inside, the girl followed her, and I went in too. When I realized that her story was true and that I had almost upset her with my unwelcome appearance, I asked her to remain quiet."
"I went for a walk; in the meantime, she had to prepare a corner of the living room for me to eat in and a room to sleep in. No sweeping or dusting was necessary, just a warm fire and dry sheets. She seemed willing to do her best, but she threw the brush through the grate, mistaking it for the poker, and misused several other items from her work. But I withdrew, trusting that she would provide me with a place to rest upon my return."
"Wuthering Heights was the destination of my outing. A memory brought me back there after I left the courthouse. ""Is everything all right at Wuthering Heights?"" I asked the woman. ""Is something going on there?"" she replied, hurrying off with a pan full of hot coals. I could have wondered why Mrs. Dean had left the Grange, but there was no way I could stop her in a situation like this. So I turned and strolled leisurely away, the glow of the setting sun behind me and the soft light of the rising moon before me—one fading, the other brightening—as I left the park and climbed the stony path that wound its way toward Mr. Heathcliff's estate."
"Before I could see it, the day was reduced to a faint amber glow in the west, but I could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass in the bright moonlight. I didn't have to climb or knock on the gate: it simply gave way. That's an improvement, I thought."
"And something else caught my nose: a scent of violets and wallflowers hung in the air between the simple fruit trees. Doors and screens stood open; yet, as was usual in a mining region, a beautiful red fire lit the fireplace. The comfort it provided made the additional heat bearable. But the house in Stormwind is so large that its inhabitants have enough room to escape its influence; so they had positioned themselves not far from one of the windows."
"I saw and heard them talking even before I entered, so I watched and listened, driven by a mixture of curiosity and envy that grew the longer I lingered. ""On the contrary!"" said a voice, soft as a silver bell. ""That's the third time, you idiot! I won't tell you again. Remember it, or I'll tear your hair out!"" ""On the contrary,"" replied another in a deep but gentle voice. ""And now kiss me for your attention."" ""No, first read it carefully, without making a single mistake."" The speaker began to read: It was a young man, appropriately dressed, sitting at a table, a book in front of her. Her beautiful face beamed with joy, and her gaze wandered impatiently from the page to a small white hand on her shoulder, which reminded her with a sharp slap on the cheek whenever the owner noticed such signs of inattention."
"The landlady stood behind him; her light, glossy curls mingled now and then with her brown eyes as she bent down to help him study; and her face—fortunately, he couldn't see it, or he would never have been so consistent. I could; and I bit my lip, unable to do anything but stare at her enchanting beauty. The task was completed, not without further mistakes; but the apprentice demanded a reward and received at least five kisses, which he generously returned."
"Then they came to the door, and their conversation revealed to me that they were taking a walk on the moor. I suspected that if I showed myself unhappy in his presence, not in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, but in his mouth, I would be condemned to the depths of hell. Feeling very wicked and malicious, I sought shelter in the kitchen. There, too, access was free. By the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song. This was often interrupted from within by harsh words of contempt and intolerance, spoken in unmusical accents. ""I would rather have had her cursing in my arms all morning to hear you than listen to you!"" said the kitchen maid, in answer to an inaudible rejoinder from Nelly. ""It is a terrible shame that I cannot open the Holy Book, but that you have dedicated that glory to Satan and all the vile wickedness that ever saw the light of day! Oh! You are a good man; and another one too; and this poor fellow will be lost among you."
"""Poor fellow!"" he added, groaning. ""He's bewitched. I'm not making this up. Lord, judge them, for there is no law and justice of the North under our rulers!"" ""No! Otherwise we'd be in the fog, I think,"" replied the singer. ""But make a wish, old fellow, read your Bible like a Christian and pay me no attention. It's 'Fairy Annie's Wedding'—a lovely tune—we'll dance."" Mrs. Dean was about to continue when I appeared. She recognized me at once, jumped up, and cried, ""What, sir, Mr. Lockwood! How can you come back like this? Everything's closed at Thrushcross Grange."""
"You should have warned us! ""I have arranged lodgings for my stay there,"" I replied. ""I am leaving tomorrow. And how did you get here, Mrs. Dean? Tell me."" ""Zillah is gone, and Mr. Heathcliff wanted me to come to London soon after your departure and stay until you returned. But please, come in! Did you walk from Gimmerton this evening?"" ""From the manor,"" I replied, ""and while they are taking care of my lodgings, I wish to settle my affairs with your master; for I do not think I shall have an opportunity of doing so again any time soon."" ""What affairs, sir?"" asked Nelly, ushering me in. ""He is away at the moment and will not be back soon."" ""About the rent,"" I replied. ""Oh! Then you must settle that with Mrs. Heathcliff,"" she remarked, ""or rather, with me."""
"She hasn't yet learned to manage her own affairs, and I'm taking her place: there's no one else. I seemed surprised. ""Ah! You haven't heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,"" she continued. ""Heathcliff is dead!"" I cried, surprised. ""How long ago was that?"" ""Three months ago: but sit down, let me take your hat, and I'll tell you all about it. Hold, you haven't eaten anything yet, have you?"" ""I don't want anything: I've ordered dinner home. Sit down, too."""
"I never dreamed of her death! Tell me what it was like. You say you're not expecting the young people soon? ""No, I have to scold them every night for wandering around late, but they don't like me. At least drink a glass of our old beer; it will do you good, you look tired."" She hurried off to get it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph ask if it was ""a pity that at her age she already had pupils? And then to fetch the children from the master's cellar!"" He was ashamed to ""wait a little longer."" She didn't stop for revenge, but returned a moment later with a sparkling silver pint, the contents of which I praised with due seriousness."
"And then she told me the rest of Heathcliff's story. It had, as she called it, a ""strange"" ending. ""Two weeks after your departure, I was summoned to Wuthering Heights,"" she told me; and I gladly obeyed, for Catherine's sake."
My first conversation with her was sad and dismaying: she had changed so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff didn't explain to me why he had changed his mind about my coming; he simply said he wanted me and was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the living room my living room and keep her with me. It was enough for him to see her once or twice a day.
"She seemed content with this arrangement; and little by little, I smuggled in a large number of the books and articles that had kept her entertained at the Grange, flattering myself that we would survive the time reasonably comfortably. This illusion, however, did not last long. Catherine, initially content, soon became irritable and restless."
"First, she wasn't allowed to leave the garden, and it annoyed her immensely to be locked up there in the spring; second, I often had to leave her alone while I looked after the house, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarreling with Joseph in the kitchen to being quietly alone. Her skirmishes didn't bother me, but Hareton often had to go into the kitchen too when the master wanted the house to himself! And although at first she would quietly leave the kitchen in his presence, or discreetly interfere in my activities, avoid remarks, or talk to him—and although he was always as sullen and taciturn as possible—after a while she changed her behavior and could no longer leave him alone: she talked to him; noticed his stupidity and laziness; marveled that he could maintain this way of life, that he could spend an entire evening staring into the fire and dozing. ""He's like a dog, isn't he, Ellen?"" ""Or a cart-horse?"" He works, eats, and sleeps forever! What an empty, sullen mind he must have! Do you dream sometimes, Hareton? And if so, about what? But you can't talk to me!' Then she looked at him; but he neither opened his mouth nor looked at her again. 'Perhaps he's dreaming now,' she continued. 'He pulled her by the shoulder while Juno pulled him. Ask him, Ellen.' 'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to let you ride if you don't behave!' I said."
"Not only did he have a bent shoulder, but his fist was also clenched, as if he were tempted to use it. ""I know why Hareton never says anything when I'm in the kitchen,"" she exclaimed another time. ""He's afraid I'll make fun of him. Ellen, what do you think? One day he started teaching himself to read; and when I laughed, he burned his books and dropped them. Wasn't he stupid?"" ""You weren't naughty?"" I asked. ""Give me this."" ""Perhaps,"" she continued, ""but I didn't think he was so stupid. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll try!"" She placed one in his hand, which she read attentively; he threw it away, muttering that he would break her neck if she didn't give it up. ""Well, I'll put it in the table drawer here,"" she said, ""and then I'll go to bed."" Then she whispered to me to be careful when he touched it and left."
"But he didn't want to think about it, so I told him the next morning, much to his disappointment. I noticed that she regretted her persistent bad mood and laziness: her conscience reproached her for preventing him from improving, which she had indeed done. But her ingenuity helped repair the damage: While I was ironing or doing other mundane chores that I couldn't properly do in the salon, she would bring me a good book and read to me."
"When Hareton was there, she would usually stop at an interesting text and leave the book lying there. She did this often. But he was as stubborn as a mule, and instead of grabbing her in bad weather, he took to smoking with Joseph. They sat like automatons on either side of the fireplace. The elder, fortunately, was too deaf to understand her sordid nonsense, as he would have called it, while the younger did his best to pretend he knew nothing about it. On fine evenings, the latter would follow his shots, and Catherine would yawn and sigh, teasing me to speak to her, and running into the yard or garden as soon as I started. And as a last resort, she would cry and say she was tired of living: her life was worthless. Mr. Heathcliff, who liked company less and less, had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment."
"At the beginning of March, an accident forced him to spend several days in the kitchen. His rifle exploded while he was alone in the mountains; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a lot of blood before he could return home. He was therefore forced to stay by the fire and rest until he regained his strength."
"Catherine was pleased with his presence; well, she hated it more than ever, and made me do some things downstairs so she could accompany me. On Easter Monday, Joseph took cattle to Gimmerton Fair; and in the afternoon I was busy hanging up the washing in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat gloomily by the fire, as usual, and my little mistress amused herself for an hour by painting at the windows, alternating her conversation with suppressed singing, whispered exclamations, and quick, irritated, and impatient glances at her cousin, who smoked incessantly and stared at the grate."
"When I realized I could no longer bear her blocking my light, she went to the fireplace. I paid little attention to her antics, but suddenly heard her begin: ""I have found, Hareton, that I wish—and am glad—I had you for a cousin now, if you had not been so angry and brutal to me."" Hareton did not reply. ""Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! Do you hear me?"" she continued. ""Go away!"" he growled relentlessly. ""Let me get the pipe,"" she said, gently snatching it from his mouth. Before he could take it, it had broken and lay behind the fire."
"He scolded her and took another. ""Stop,"" she cried, ""you must listen to me first; and I cannot speak while these clouds hover over my face."" ""Go to hell!"" he cried desperately, ""and leave me alone!"" ""No,"" she insisted, ""I will not. I don't know how to make you talk, and I'm sure you won't understand. When I call you an idiot, I don't do it out of mere contempt: I don't mean that I despise you. Come, listen to me, Hareton. You are my cousin, and you will know me."" ""I will have nothing more to do with you, with your filthy pride and your damned sneers!"" he replied. ""I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I look askance at you again."""
"""Out of the gate, at once!"" Catherine frowned and retreated to the windowsill, biting her lip and trying to conceal her growing tendency to sob by humming an eccentric tune. ""You should make friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,"" I interrupted, ""as she repents of her insolence. It would do you a great deal of good; you would become a different person to have her for company."" ""Company!"" he cried; ""while she hates me and does not think me worthy to wash her! No, if that made me a king, I should no longer be despised for seeking her favor."" ""It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!"" sobbed Cathy, unable to hide her grief. ""You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff, and more."" ""You're a damned liar,"" Earnshaw began, ""so why did I make him angry by taking your side a hundred times? And all this while you laughed at me and despised me and... Go on with me, and I'll come in and say you drove me out of the kitchen!"" ""I didn't know you were on my side,"" she answered, wiping her eyes, ""and I was miserable and bitter about everyone; but now I thank you and beg your pardon: what else can I do?"" She went back to the hearth and openly held out her hand to him. His face darkened, and he frowned like a thunderstorm, his fists tightly clenched, his eyes fixed on the ground."
"Catherine must have instinctively suspected that it was not dislike but stubborn obstinacy that motivated this obstinacy; for after a moment's hesitation, she leaned forward and pressed a tender kiss on his cheek. The little beast, thinking I hadn't seen her, drew back and very demurely resumed her usual place by the window. I shook my head disapprovingly, and then she blushed and murmured, ""Well, what could I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake my hand or look at me: I had to show him that I liked him, that I wanted to be his friend."" I don't know whether the kiss convinced Hareton: for several minutes he was very careful not to show his face, and when he raised it, he had absolutely no idea where to direct his gaze."
"Catherine was busy carefully wrapping a beautiful book in white paper, securing it with a ribbon, and addressing it to ""Mr. Hareton Earnshaw."" She asked me to be her ambassador and deliver the gift to the recipient. ""And tell him, if he accepts it, I'll come and show him how to read it properly,"" she said. ""And if he refuses, I'll come upstairs and never bother him again."" I carried the book and repeated the message under the worried gaze of my employer. Hareton refused to open his fingers, so I placed it on his lap. He didn't cross it out either."
"I turned back to my work. Catherine rested her head and arms on the table until she heard the soft rustle of the bedspread being thrown back; then she stepped back and sat quietly beside her cousin. He was trembling, his face glowing; all his coarseness and sullen hardness had left him. At first, he couldn't summon the courage to utter a single syllable in response to her questioning look and murmured plea. ""Tell me you forgive me, Hareton, do."""
"""You can make me so happy with that little word."" He muttered something unintelligible. ""And you'll be my friend?"" Catherine added questioningly. ""No, you'll be ashamed of me all your life,"" he replied; ""and the more ashamed you are, the better you know me; and I can't bear that."" ""Then you won't be my friend?"" she said with a honey-sweet smile, approaching. I heard no more intelligible conversation, but when I turned around, I saw two faces so radiant, bent over the page of the accepted book, that I had no doubt that the treaty had been ratified by both sides and that the enemies were now sworn allies. The work they were studying was full of valuable paintings; and these, along with their position, had enough charm to leave them cold until Joseph's return."
"He, poor man, was astonished to see Catherine sitting on the same bench as Hareton Earnshaw, her hand on his shoulder; and amazed at his favorite's patience in enduring her presence: it affected him too deeply to make any comment on it that evening. His emotion was revealed only in the deep sighs he heaved as he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table and covered it with dirty banknotes from his pocketbook, the proceeds of the day's dealings. Finally, he called Hareton from his seat. ""Take this to the Lord, my boy,"" he said, ""and stay there."""
"I'm going home. This house is neither manly nor fitting for us: we must go out and find another. ""Come, Catherine,"" I said, ""we must go out too: I've been there again. Are you ready to go?"" ""It's not eight o'clock yet!"" she answered, rising reluctantly. ""Hareton, I'll leave this book on the mantelpiece and bring another tomorrow."" ""Any books you leave I'll take home,"" said Joseph, ""and if you find them somewhere else, that's a bonus; then you'll consider yourself lucky!"" Cathy threatened to make her library pay for hers; and smiling as she passed Hareton, she went upstairs singing: lighter at heart, I dare say, than she had ever felt under that roof; except perhaps on her first visits to Linton."
"The intimacy thus established grew rapidly, but was occasionally interrupted. Earnshaw was not very desirable, and my young wife was neither a philosopher nor a model of patience; but since they both pursued the same goal—one loved and desired appreciation, the other loved and desired to be appreciated—they eventually achieved it. You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was quite easy to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart."
"But now I'm glad you didn't try. The crowning of all my hopes will be the union of these two. I will envy no one on their wedding day: there will be no happier woman in England than me! The day after that Monday, when Earnshaw was still unable to go to his usual work and therefore stayed at home, I soon realized that it would be impossible to keep my nurse by my side as before."
"She led me downstairs into the garden, where she had observed her cousin performing menial tasks. When I invited her to lunch, I saw that she had persuaded him to clear a large patch of gooseberry and currant bushes, and that they were in the process of importing seedlings from the manor. I was appalled at the mischief that had been caused within half an hour; the currant bushes were Joseph's favorite, and she had just selected a group of them. ""Now! All this will be shown to the master,"" I cried, ""as soon as it is discovered. And what excuse have you to me for these liberties in the garden? We shall be amused; we shall see! Mr. Hareton, I wonder if you have not enough sense to go at his bidding and make such a mess!"" ""I forgot they belonged to Joseph,"" replied Earnshaw, somewhat surprised. ""But I will tell him I did it."" We always dined with Mr. Heathcliff."
"I did the housework: making tea and cutting; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine usually sat next to me, but that day she moved closer to Hareton; and I soon realized that she was as reserved in her friendship as she was in her hostility. ""Be careful not to talk too much to your cousin or pay too much attention to him,"" I whispered to her as I entered the room. ""That would certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he would be angry with both of you."" ""I won't,"" she replied. A minute later, she had walked over to him and was putting primroses into his bowl of porridge."
"He dared not speak to her; he hardly dared to look at her; and yet she continued to tease him until twice he almost burst out laughing. I frowned, and then she looked at the gentleman, whose thoughts, as his face betrayed, were elsewhere than his company; and for a moment she became serious again and regarded him with profound seriousness. Then she turned away and resumed her chatter; finally, Hareton gave a stifled laugh."
"Mr. Heathcliff flinched; his gaze flickered over our faces. Catherine returned his usual nervous, provocative glare, which he detested. ""Luckily you're out of reach,"" he cried. ""What the devil has possessed you to stare at me with those devilish eyes all the time? Go away! And never remind me of your existence again. I thought I'd cured you of laughter."" ""I have,"" murmured Hareton. ""What do you say to that?"" asked the gentleman. Hareton looked down at his plate and didn't repeat his confession."
"Mr. Heathcliff looked at him for a moment, then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted reflections. We were almost finished, and the two young men crept cautiously away. I had therefore not expected to be further disturbed during the meeting when Joseph appeared in the doorway and, with a quivering lip and an angry look, revealed that the atrocities against his precious shrubberies had been noticed. He must have seen Cathy and her cousin before investigating, because despite his chattering jaw and his slurred speech, he began: ""I need my wages, and then I must be off! I had intended to go to where I had saved for sixty years; and I thought I would put my books and all my things up in the attic, and then they would take over the kitchen for peace and quiet."""
"It was hard leaving my old home, but I thought I could! But no, my garden is mine, and by God, Lord, I can't bear it! Make yourself comfortable—I never have before, and an old man doesn't get used to new houses so quickly. I'd rather throw my food and croquettes out into the street!' 'Come on, you idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'be brief! What's wrong with you? I don't interfere in your quarrels with Nelly. She can throw you into the pit for any reason.' 'It isn't Nelly!' retorted Joseph. 'I'm not moving for Nelly—it's not dirty.'"
"Thank goodness! Shoo cannot make the nobleman's soul turn pale! Shoo was so beautiful, but what a body when she winks! It was that sweet, graceful lady who charmed our boy with her pert face and her prejudices—until—No! It really pains me! He has forgotten all I have done for him, and all I have done to him, and he is cutting down a whole row of the biggest gooseberry bushes in the garden!' And here he was complaining openly, insensible to his bitter injuries, about Earnshaw's ingratitude and the dangerous situation. 'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff. 'Hareton, is he criticizing you?' 'I have pulled up two or three bushes,' answered the young man, 'but I will replant them.' 'And why did you pull them up?' asked the gentleman. Catherine wisely stuck out her tongue. 'They wanted to plant flowers over there,' she cried. 'I'm the only one responsible for that, because I was the one who wanted them to do it.' 'And who in God's name gave you permission to touch a stick over there?' her father-in-law asked, very surprised. 'And who ordered you to obey him?' he added, turning to Hareton."
"He stood speechless; his cousin retorted: ""You shouldn't deny me a few yards of land to decorate when you've taken all my land!"" ""Your land, you insolent little thing! You never had anything,"" said Heathcliff. ""And my money,"" she continued; she met his gaze and bit into a piece of crust, the remainder of her breakfast. ""Hush!"" he cried. ""Get out of here and go!"" ""And Hareton's land and his money,"" continued the imprudent man. ""Hareton and I are friends now; and I'll tell him all about you!"" The gentleman seemed stunned for a moment; he turned pale and stood up, looking at her all the time with an expression of deadly hatred. ""If you hit me, Hareton will hit you,"" she said; ""so you'd better sit down."" ""If Hareton doesn't get you out, I'll beat the hell out of him,"" thundered Heathcliff. ""Damned witch! Do you dare set him against me? Let her go! Do you hear? Throw her into the kitchen! I'll finish her, Ellen Dean, if you let her appear before me again!"" Hareton tried to calm her in a low voice. ""Take her away!"" he cried desperately. ""Will you stay and talk?"" And he stepped forward to carry out his own command. ""He will disobey you, wicked man,"" said Catherine; ""and soon he will hate you as much as I do."" ""Wish for it! Wish for it!"" murmured the young man reproachfully; ""I won't let you talk to him like that. That's all."" ""But you won't let him hit me, will you?"" she cried. ""Go on,"" he murmured gravely. It was too late: Heathcliff had seized her. ""Go on!"" he said to Earnshaw. ""Damned witch!"" This time she provoked me when I could bear it no longer; And I'll make her regret it forever! Her hand was in her hair; Hareton tried to avert his gaze, begging him not to hurt her this time."
"Heathcliff's black eyes flashed; he seemed to be tearing Catherine to pieces, and the thought of risking her rescue was just exciting me when his fingers suddenly loosened; he shifted his grip from her head to her arm and looked at her intently. Then, covering his eyes with one hand, he stood a moment to compose himself, turned back to Catherine, and said, seemingly calmly: ""You must learn not to provoke me, or I'll kill you one day! Go with Mrs. Dean and stay with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. And as for Hareton Earnshaw: if I see him listening to you, I'll send him to fetch his bread wherever he can find it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar."""
"Nelly, take her away! And leave me all alone! Leave me alone! I led my young wife out; she was too happy with her escape to resist; the other followed her, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself until dinner. I had advised Catherine to dine upstairs, but as soon as he saw her place vacant, he sent for her. He didn't speak a word to us, ate very little, and left immediately, pretending he would not return until evening."
"The two new friends settled down in the house during his absence, where I heard Hareton severely rebuke his niece when she made a revelation to him about her stepfather's conduct. He said he would not tolerate a word of contempt: if he were the devil, it would mean nothing; he would support him; and he would rather she abuse herself as she used to, than speak ill of Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was furious at this; but he found a way to silence her by asking her how she would feel if he spoke ill of her father. She then understood that Earnshaw was usurping the Lord's reputation, and that he was in fetters stronger than reason could break—chains forged by habit, and which it would be cruel to break."
"From then on, she showed good cheer by avoiding complaints and expressions of dislike toward Heathcliff. She confessed to me her sorrow at having stirred up tensions between him and Hareton. Indeed, I don't believe she ever uttered a word against her oppressor in his presence since then. This little quarrel settled, they were friends again and as busy as possible with their various duties as pupil and teacher. I sat with them after finishing my work and felt so soothed and comforted by the sight of them that I didn't notice how quickly the time passed."
"They both looked, in some ways, like my children: I had long been proud of one, and now I was sure the other would give me just as much joy. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature quickly dispelled the clouds of ignorance and humiliation in which he had grown up; and Catherine's sincere praise spurred his zeal. Her cheerfulness lit up his face and gave him enthusiasm and generosity: I could hardly imagine that this was the same person I had seen the day I rediscovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights after her expedition to the Crags."
"While I admired them and they gave their best, dusk fell, and with it the professor. He met us unexpectedly as we entered through the front door and saw all three of us before we could even raise our heads to look at him. Well, I thought, there had never been a more pleasant and innocent sight; and it would be a shame to blame them."
"The red glow of the fire illuminated their two beautiful heads and revealed their faces, filled with the excitement of childlike enthusiasm. For although he was twenty-three and she eighteen, both had so much to experience and learn that they neither felt nor displayed the emotions of a sober and disillusioned adult. They looked up together at Mr. Heathcliff: they may never have noticed that their eyes are identical and that they belong to Catherine Earnshaw. The Catherine of today resembles him in nothing, except in her broad forehead and the flared nostrils, which, whether she wants it or not, give her a somewhat haughty appearance."
"At Hareton, the resemblance went even further: it is always remarkable, but it was especially striking, for his senses were sharpened and his mental faculties aroused to unusual activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he went to the fireplace, visibly agitated; but his agitation soon vanished when he looked at the young man; or rather, its manner changed, for it was still there. He took the book from her hand, glanced at the open page, and then returned it to her without a word; he merely beckoned to Catherine. Her companion remained standing behind her for a moment, and I was about to start, but he ordered me to remain silent. ""This is a poor termination, is it not?"" he remarked, after reflecting for a moment on the scene he had just witnessed. ""An absurd termination to my violent exertions? I will take levers and pickaxes to demolish the two houses and practice working like Hercules."" And when everything is ready and within my power, I realize that the desire to lift a slate from the roof has vanished! My old enemies have not defeated me; the time has come to take revenge on their representatives: I could do it, and no one could stop me."
"But why? I don't like hitting: I don't want to raise my hand! It seems as if all this time I've been making an effort to show generosity. This is far from the case: I've lost the ability to appreciate its destruction and am too lazy to destroy for nothing. ""Nelly, a strange change is about to happen; I'm standing in its shadow right now. I'm so uninterested in my daily life that I hardly think about food or drink anymore."""
"These two people who have left the room are the only objects that still have a distinct material appearance for me; and this appearance pains me, almost frightens me. I don't want to speak of her; and I don't want to think of her; but I ardently wish she were invisible; her presence only arouses mad feelings in me. He has a different effect on me: and yet, if I could, without appearing mad, I would never see him again! ""You might think,"" he added, trying to smile, ""I am more inclined to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas that he evokes or embodies."""
"But you will not speak of what I tell you; and my thoughts are so eternally absent that I am tempted to entrust them to someone else. Five minutes ago, Hareton seemed to me a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt so differently about him that it would have been impossible for me to speak to him rationally. In the first place, his striking resemblance to Catherine bound him to her in a terrible way. Yet what you may take to be the strongest stimulus to my imagination is in reality the least: for what is not connected with her? And what does not remind me of her? I cannot look upon this ground without seeing her features in the flagstones! In every cloud, in every tree—filling the sky at night and discernible in every object by day—I am surrounded by her image! The most commonplace faces of men and women—my own—taunted me with their resemblance."
"The whole world is now nothing but a horrible heap of memories of his existence and my loss! Hareton's appearance was now the shadow of my undying love, my desperate attempts to assert my rights, my humiliation, my pride, my happiness, and my fear. ""But it is foolish to repeat these thoughts to you: you will only understand why, as he does not always wish to be alone, his company is of no use; it rather aggravates my constant torment; and it partly contributes to my inability to understand how he and his cousin get along. I can no longer pay any attention to them."" ""But what do you mean by CHANGE, Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked, surprised at his behavior. Yet, in my opinion, he was in no danger of losing his mind or dying: he was perfectly strong and healthy; and as for his mind, he had, since childhood, delighted in thinking obscure things and entertaining strange fancies. He was perhaps a little monomaniacal about his deceased idol, but in every other respect he was as perceptive as I. ""I'll only know in due time,"" he said; ""I'm only half aware of it now."" ""You don't feel ill, do you?"" I asked. ""No, Nelly, I don't,"" he replied. ""Then you're not afraid of death?"" I continued. ""Afraid? No!"" he replied. ""I have no fear, no premonition, no hope of dying."""
"Why should I? With my austere constitution, temperate lifestyle, and harmless pursuits, I could, and probably will, remain on the surface until not a hair remains. And yet I cannot remain in this state! I must remember to breathe—almost remind my heart to beat! And it is like twisting a stiff spring: out of compulsion I perform the slightest action not prompted by a single thought; and out of compulsion I perceive everything, animate or inanimate, that is not connected with a universal idea. I have a single desire, and my whole being and all my power yearn to gratify it."
"You have desired it so long and so ardently that I am convinced it will be attained—and soon—for it has occupied my whole life: the expectation of its fulfillment consumes me. My confessions have not calmed me; but they may explain certain otherwise inexplicable outbursts of anger which I manifest. ""Oh dear! It is a long struggle; I wish it were over!"" He began to pace the room, muttering horrible things to himself, until, as he said, Joseph's act, I became convinced that his conscience had transformed his heart into an earthly hell."
"I was very curious to see how it would end. Although he had rarely shown this mood before, even by his appearance, it was his usual mood, I had no doubt about it. He declared it himself; but no one would have guessed it from his general demeanor. Nor would you, when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood. And at the time I speak of, he was exactly the same as he was then; only he loved eternal solitude more and was perhaps even more taciturn in company."
"For a few days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff avoided meeting us at dinner; yet he did not formally exclude Hareton and Cathy. He hated giving in to his feelings so completely and preferred to stay out of each other's way; one meal every twenty-four hours seemed sufficient to him. One evening, after the family had gone to bed, I heard him come downstairs and go out by the front door."
"I never heard him come in again, and the next morning I noticed that he was still not there. It was now April: the weather was mild and warm, the grass as green as sunshine and rain could make it, and the two dwarf apple trees against the south wall were in full blossom. After breakfast, Catherine insisted that I fetch a chair and sit under the pines at the end of the house to work; and she persuaded Hareton, who had fully recovered from his accident, to dig and cultivate his little garden, which he had moved there because of Joseph's illness."
"I was enjoying the spring fragrance around me and the beautiful, soft blue sky when my young wife, who had run to the gate to fetch primrose roots for a bed, returned half-laden and announced Mr. Heathcliff's arrival. ""And he spoke to me,"" she added in surprise. ""What did he say?"" asked Hareton. ""He told me to go as quickly as possible,"" she replied. ""But he looked so different from his usual self that I stood staring at him for a moment."" ""How?"" he asked. ""Well, almost cheerful and jolly. No, ALMOST nothing—VERY excited, spirited, and happy!"" she replied. ""Evening strolls amuse him then,"" I remarked casually: indeed, as surprised as she was, and eager to know the truth behind his words; for to see the gentleman happy would not be a common sight. I sought an excuse to enter."
"Heathcliff stood at the open door; he was pale and trembling; but there was undoubtedly a strange, cheerful gleam in his eyes, which gave a different expression to his face. ""Will you have breakfast?"" I asked. ""You must be hungry after wandering about all night!"" I wanted to know where he had gone, but I did not want to ask him directly. ""No, I am not hungry,"" he answered, turning his head away and speaking with a certain contempt, as if he suspected that I was trying to guess the reason for his good humor. I was perplexed: I did not know whether this was not an opportunity to reprove him a little. ""I do not think it would be right to go out,"" I remarked, ""instead of lying in bed: it is not wise, at least not in this wet season. I'll wager you will catch a bad cold or a fever: there is something wrong with you now!"" ""Nothing, except what I can bear,"" he replied; ""And with the greatest pleasure, provided you leave me alone: Come upstairs and don't disturb me."" I obeyed; and as I passed, I noticed that he was breathing rapidly like a cat. ""Yes!"" I said to myself, ""we're going to be sick."""
"I can't imagine what he did. That afternoon, he sat down at table with us and took a plateful from me, as if making up for his fast of the previous day. ""I have neither cold nor fever, Nelly,"" he remarked, alluding to my morning conversation; ""and I am ready to do justice to the food you give me."" He took a knife and fork and was about to begin his meal when his appetite seemed to suddenly disappear. He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, then got up and went out. We watched him pace the garden while we finished our meal, and Earnshaw said he would ask why he didn't eat; he thought we had hurt him somehow. ""Well, is he coming?"" called Catherine, as her cousin returned. ""No,"" he answered; ""but he is not angry; he seldom seemed really happy; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he asked me to go to you: he wondered how I could possibly want anyone else's company."" I put his plate on the edge to keep it warm; and in an hour or two he came back, when the room was empty, but no less calm: the same unearthly joy—it was unearthly—beneath his black brows; the same bloodless color, and his teeth were visible now and then in a kind of smile; his body trembled, not as a man trembles from cold or weakness, but as a taut rope trembles—a strong tremor instead of a shiver."
"I'll ask what's the matter, I told myself; or who would? And I cried out: ""Have you any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look unusually cheerful."" ""Where can I get any good news?"" he asked. ""I'm starving, and apparently I mustn't eat anything."" ""Your supper is here,"" I answered; ""Why don't you get it?"" ""I don't want it now,"" he murmured hastily. ""I'll wait until supper. And, Nelly, I want to ask you once and for all to keep Hareton and the others away from me. I won't be disturbed by anyone; I want this place to myself."" ""Is there any new reason for this banishment?"" I asked. ""Tell me why you're behaving so strangely, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I don't ask that question from mere curiosity, but—"" ""You ask that question from mere curiosity,"" he interrupted, laughing. ""And yet I'm going to answer him."""
"Last night I stood on the threshold of hell. Today I have my paradise within sight. I stared at it: barely a meter separates me! And now go! You won't see or hear anything that could frighten you if you don't take the trouble. After sweeping the fireplace and wiping the table, I left, more confused than ever."
"He did not leave the house again that afternoon, and no one disturbed his solitude until, at eight o'clock, I thought it best to bring him, without being asked, a candle and his supper. He was leaning on the edge of an open grate, but not looking out: his face was turned towards the inner darkness. The fire had burned down; the room was filled with the moist, sweet air of that cloudy evening; and it was so still that one could hear not only the murmur of the stream that flowed near Gimmerton, but also its trickle and splash on the pebbles, or through the large stones that it could not cover."
"At the sight of the gloomy grille, I uttered a cry of displeasure and began closing the windows one by one until I reached his own. ""Shall I close this one?"" I asked, to rouse him; for he did not move. The light shone upon his face as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot describe how terrified I was by that fleeting sight! Those pitch-black eyes! That smile and that hideous pallor! It did not look to me like Mr. Heathcliff, but like a gnome; and, filled with fear, I bent the candle toward the wall, and he left me in the dark. ""Yes, close it,"" he answered in his familiar voice. ""That is clumsy! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Come quickly and bring another."" Mad with fear, I rushed out and said to Joseph, ""The master wants you to bring him some light and cheer him up."" “Because at that moment I didn’t dare go in myself.”"
"Joseph threw a little fire into the shovel and went away, but immediately brought it back, tray in other hand, and announced that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed and would not eat anything until morning. We heard him immediately come upstairs; he did not want to go into his usual room, but into the one with the paneled bed; the window, as I said, is large enough for anyone to pass through; and I noticed that he was planning another nighttime excursion of which he preferred not to suspect. ""Is it a ghoul or a vampire?"" I wondered. I had read about these hideous, incarnate demons."
"And then I began to think about how I had nursed him as a baby, watched him grow up, and accompanied him almost his entire life; and how absurd to give in to that feeling of horror! ""But where did he come from, this dark little thing, nurtured to ruin by a good man?"" murmured Superstition as I fell asleep. And half-dreaming, I began to imagine a lineage appropriate to him; and, reflecting on my waking thoughts, I traced his existence with grim variations; finally, I imagined his death and burial: I only remember how much it vexed me to dictate an inscription for his tomb and to consult the sexton about it; and since he had no surname and we could not determine his age, we had to be content with the single word ""Heathcliff."" It became true: we were. Upon entering the cemetery, one can read only this on his tombstone, along with the date of his death."
"Dawn brought me back to my senses. I got up and went out into the garden as quickly as possible to see if there were any footprints below his window. There were none. ""He's stayed home,"" I thought, ""and he'll be fine today."" I made breakfast for the whole family as usual, but asked Hareton and Catherine to make theirs before the master came down, as he was getting home late."
"They preferred to sit outside under the trees, and I set a small table for them. When I returned, I found Mr. Heathcliff downstairs. He and Joseph were discussing agricultural matters; he gave clear and detailed instructions, but spoke quickly, constantly turning his head away, and showing the same, if not greater, agitation."
"When Joseph left the room, he sat down in his usual place, and I placed a cup of coffee before him. He brought it closer, rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite wall. I suspected he was examining some part of it from top to bottom with bright, anxious eyes, and with such lively interest that he held his breath for half a minute. ""Now, now,"" I cried, pressing some bread into his hand, ""eat and drink this while it's still hot: he's been waiting nearly an hour."" He didn't notice me, yet he smiled. I would have preferred to see him grind his teeth than smile like that. ""Mr. Heathcliff! Master!"" I cried, ""for goodness' sake, don't stare at me as if you were seeing a vision from another world."" ""For goodness' sake, don't shout so loudly,"" he replied. ""Turn around and tell me, are we alone?"" ""Of course,"" I answered, ""of course."" Yet I obeyed him involuntarily, as if I weren't entirely sure."
"With a wave of his hand, he made room in front of him in the middle of breakfast and leaned forward to continue his silent gaze. I noticed that he wasn't looking at the wall; for when I observed him alone, I had the impression he was staring at something two meters away. And whatever it was, it evidently expressed pleasure and pain in exquisite and refined forms: at least, that's what the tortured and ecstatic expression on his face suggested."
"The object, too, was not fixed: his gaze followed it with tireless impatience, and even when he spoke to me, he was undeterred. In vain, I reminded him of his long abstinence from food: when he wanted to touch something to fulfill my requests, when he reached for a piece of bread, his fingers twitched before he reached it and remained on the table, unaware of their purpose. Sitting down, a model of patience, I tried to distract him from his thoughts until he stood up, irritated, and asked me why I didn't give him time to eat. And I told him that next time I wouldn't have to wait: I could put my things down and leave."
"With that, he left the house, walked slowly along the garden path, and disappeared under the gate. The hours passed anxiously: another evening was dawning. I didn't go to bed until late, and when I did, I couldn't sleep."
"He returned after midnight and, instead of going to bed, locked himself in the room downstairs. I listened, tossed and turned a little, finally got dressed and went downstairs. It was too exhausting to lie there, tormenting my mind with a thousand empty thoughts."
"I heard Mr. Heathcliff's footsteps as he paced anxiously back and forth, and every now and then he broke the silence with a deep, groaning inspiration. He also murmured single words; the only one I could understand was the name Catherine, accompanied by a strange address, affectionate or sad; and he pronounced it as one addresses someone: softly and seriously, and it came from the depths of his soul. I didn't have the courage to go directly into the apartment; but I wanted to distract him from his reveries, so I let myself be carried away by the kitchen fire, stoked it, and began to scrape the embers."
"This brought him out earlier than expected. He immediately opened the door and said to me, ""Nelly, come here, is it morning? Come in with your lamp."" ""It's striking four,"" I replied. ""You need a candle; you could have lit it here by the fire."" ""No, I won't come up,"" he said. ""Come in, light me a fire, and do what needs doing in the room."" ""I have to light the embers first before I can carry them,"" I replied, grabbing a chair and the bellows. Meanwhile, he paced frantically back and forth; his heavy sighs followed one another so loudly that there was no room for a collective intake of breath. ""At daybreak, I'll have Green summoned,"" he said. ""I want to initiate some legal proceedings against him while I think things over and can act in peace. I haven't made my will yet; and how I will leave my estate, I don't yet know."""
"I wish I could erase it from the face of the earth. ""I wouldn't speak like that, Mr. Heathcliff,"" I interrupted. ""Let your will hold out a little longer: you'll have time to repent of your many mistakes! I didn't think your nerves would be on the verge of breaking down. Yet, astonishing as it may seem, they are right now; and almost entirely through your own fault. The way you've spent the last three days, a Titan might wake up. Eat and rest."""
"You only have to look in the mirror to see how much you need both. Your cheeks are sunken and your eyes bloodshot, as if you're starving and going blind from lack of sleep. ""It's not my fault I can't eat or rest,"" he replied. ""I assure you, it's not my intention. I will do both, as soon as possible."""
"But you might as well ask a man struggling in the water to rest an arm's length from the shore! I must get there first, and then I will rest. Now, leave Mr. Green alone: as for remorse for my wrongs, I have done nothing wrong and regret nothing. I am too happy; and yet I am not happy enough."
"The bliss of my soul kills my body, but it is not satisfied. ""Happy, Master?"" I cried. ""Strange happiness! If you would listen to me without anger, perhaps I could give you some advice that would make you happier."" ""What?"" he asked. ""Give it."" ""Do you know, Mr. Heathcliff,"" I said, ""that since you were thirteen, you have lived a selfish and unchristian life, and that in all that time you have probably hardly ever held a Bible in your hand. You have probably forgotten the contents of the book and perhaps no longer have time to consult it. Would it be dangerous to call someone—a minister of any denomination, it doesn't matter which—to explain it to you and show you how far you have strayed from his commandments and how unworthy you will be of this paradise if something is not changed before your death?"" ""I am more grateful than angry, Nelly,"" he said, ""because you remind me how I want to be buried."""
"It must be taken to the cemetery this evening. You and Hareton can accompany me if you wish. Above all, see that the sexton follows my instructions regarding the two coffins! The coming of a priest is pointless; there is nothing to say about me. I tell you, I have almost reached MY heaven; the other's is unimportant, and I will not betray it. ""And suppose you persist in your obstinate fasting and die from it, and they refuse to bury you on the church grounds?"" I asked, shocked by his impious indifference. ""What do you mean?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""If so, you must have me secretly removed; and if not, you practically prove that the dead are not exterminated!"" As soon as he heard the other family members stir, he retired to his study, and I breathed more freely. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were working, he returned to the kitchen, looked at me in bewilderment, and asked me to sit beside him. He wanted someone to be with him."
"I refused, telling him openly that his strange language and behavior frightened me, and I had neither the courage nor the desire to be alone with him. ""I think you take me for a devil,"" he said with his grim smile, ""something too vile to live under a decent roof."" Then, turning to Catherine, who was there and had stood behind me as he approached, he added, half-mockingly, ""Will you come with me, Chuck? I won't hurt you. No! Because of you, I've made myself worse than the devil. There's one who won't shrink from my company! By God! She's merciless."""
"Oh, damn! This is indescribably too hard for flesh and blood, even for me. He no longer sought company. As night fell, he returned to his room. All night and into the early hours, we heard him moaning and muttering."
"Hareton was desperate to get in, but I told him to get Mr. Kenneth; he would visit him. When he arrived, I asked to be admitted and tried to open the door, but it was locked. Heathcliff said we were lost. He was feeling better and wanted to be alone; so the doctor left."
"The following evening was very rainy; it even rained until morning; and as I took my morning walk around the house, I saw the professor's window open and the rain pouring down in torrents. He couldn't be in bed, I thought: those showers would soak him completely. He had to be standing or outside."
"But I won't make a fuss, I'll go boldly and see to it."" I entered with another key and ran to open the panels, for the room was empty. I quickly pushed them aside and peered inside. Mr. Heathcliff lay there on his back. His gaze met mine with such sharpness and force that I flinched; then he seemed to smile."
"I couldn't believe he was dead, but his face and neck were soaked with rain; the sheets were dripping, and he lay perfectly still. The slamming of the grate had grazed a hand on the windowsill; no blood flowed from his abraded skin, and when I placed my fingers there, I could no longer doubt: he was dead, dead! I rushed to the window; I pulled his long black hair back from his forehead; I tried to close his eyes, to extinguish, if possible, that terrifying, vivid expression of joy before anyone saw it. They refused to close: they seemed to mock my attempts; and his parted lips and pointed white teeth mocked me too! Overcome by a new wave of cowardice, I called Joseph."
"Joseph shuffled forward and made a noise, but stubbornly refused to intervene. ""The devil has torn out his soul,"" he cried, ""and he can even give me his body in return! Ah! How miserable he looks, so close to death!"" The old sinner smiled mockingly. I thought he was joking by the bedside; but suddenly he came to his senses, fell to his knees, raised his hands, and thanked his rightful master and the old family for their place back. I was stunned by this terrible event; and my memories inevitably returned with a depressing sadness."
"But poor Hareton, who suffered most from his grief, was the only one who suffered deeply. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping bitterly and sincerely. He pressed the hand and kissed the sarcastic and grim face that everyone ignored; and he wept for her with that deep sorrow that springs from a generous heart, even one as hard as tempered steel."
"Mr. Kenneth couldn't determine what illness the gentleman had died of. I concealed the fact that he hadn't eaten for four days, for fear it might upset him. Furthermore, I'm convinced he hadn't abstained voluntarily: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause. We buried him, as he had wished, to the great dismay of the entire neighborhood."
"Earnshaw, myself, the sexton, and six men who were to carry the coffin made up the entire assembly. The six men left after lowering the coffin into the grave; we stayed to attend the funeral. Hareton, his face streaming with blood, dug up some green turf and laid it himself on the brown earth. It is now as smooth and green as the surrounding hills, and I hope its occupant is sleeping as soundly."
"But the country folk, if asked, would swear on the Bible that he is GONE: some claim to have met him in the church, on the moor, and even in this house. Nonsense, you may say, and I say it too. Yet this old man by the kitchen fire claims to have seen two of them looking out of his bedroom window every rainy night since his death: and a strange thing happened to me about a month ago."
"I was walking to the Grange one evening—it was dark and a thunderstorm threatened—and just as the hills began to curve, I met a small boy with a sheep and two lambs in front of him. He was crying terribly; I assumed the lambs were nervous and refused to be led. ""What's the matter, little man?"" I asked. ""There's Heathcliff and a woman under the tree,"" he replied, ""waiting until I can outrun them."" I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go any farther, so I told him to take the lower path. He probably wanted to lighten the mood, for as he walked alone across the moor, he was thinking about the nonsense his parents and companions had been telling. Still, I don't like being in the dark now; and I don't like being alone in this gloomy house: I can't help it; I shall be glad when they leave it and go to the Grange. ""Will they go to the Grange then?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" Mrs. Dean replied, ""as soon as they are married, which will be on New Year's Day."" ""And who will live here then?"" ""Well, Joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a boy to keep him company."""
"They will live in the kitchen, and the others will be locked away. ""For the ghosts who want to live there?"" I remarked. ""No, Mr. Lockwood,"" said Nelly, shaking her head. ""I believe the dead rest in peace, but one shouldn't speak lightly of it."" At that moment, the garden gate flew open; the walkers returned. ""They are fearless,"" I murmured, watching them through the window. ""Together, they would defy Satan and all his legions."" As they stepped through the door and paused to take one last look at the moon—or, more accurately, to see each other in its light—I felt an irresistible urge to escape them again. I pressed a souvenir into Mrs. Dean's hand, ignored her warnings about my rudeness, and disappeared through the kitchen as they opened the front door. Joseph would have had to confirm his opinion of his fellow servant's amusing indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognized in me an honorable man, with the sweet voice of a prince at his feet. My return journey was prolonged by a detour to the church. There, beneath the walls, I saw that decay was already advanced, even after seven months: many windows had black holes without glass; and here and there, slate slabs protruded beyond the straight line of the roof, which would gradually be eroded in the coming autumn storms."
"I searched for and soon discovered the three gravestones on the slope beside the moor: the middle one was gray and half-buried in the heather; Edgar Linton's gravestone blended only with the grass and moss growing at its base; Heathcliff's was still bare. I lingered there under the mild sky, watching the moths flutter among the heather and bluebells, listening to the gentle breeze stirring the grass, and wondering how anyone could imagine troubled sleep for sleepers in this silent land.
