"I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.","I have just returned from a visit to my landlord, that lonely neighbor with whom I am going to get into trouble. It really is a beautiful country! I don't think I could have found a place in England so far removed from the social turmoil. A paradise for a consummate misanthrope: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are an ideal couple to share this desolation."
"A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name. 'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said. A nod was the answer. 'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts - ' 'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing. 'I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it - walk in!' The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, 'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.","A wonderful man! He had no idea how deeply I had been touched by his presence when I saw his dark eyes retract so suspiciously under his brows at my approach, and his fingers, with jealous determination, dig still deeper into his waistcoat when I called him. ""Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked. A nod was the reply. Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, I do myself the honor of calling on you as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that I have not disturbed you by my insistence on applying to occupy Thrushcross Grange. I heard yesterday that you were considering it. ""Thrushcross Grange is mine, sir,"" he interrupted, wincing. ""I would not allow anyone to disturb me if I could avoid it. Come in!"" This ""come in"" was spoken between clenched teeth and expressed the thought, ""Go to hell!"" ""Even the gate over which he was leaning showed no sign of sympathy at these words; and I think it was this circumstance which made me accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed even more reserved than I."
"When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court, - 'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse; and bring up some wine.' 'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the reflection suggested by this compound order. 'No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge- cutters.' Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy. 'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent. Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. 'Wuthering' being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.","Seeing that my horse's breast was almost over the gate, he put out his hand to untie it, then preceded me sullenly down the causeway, calling out as soon as we entered the yard, ""Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse and bring some wine."" ""We have the whole household here, I suppose,"" thought this convoluted order. ""No wonder the grass grows between the stones and the cows are the only ones to trim the hedges."" Joseph was an old man, no, an old one: very old perhaps, but vigorous and vigorous. ""The Lord help us!"" he murmured in a tone of sullen displeasure as he took my horse from me. Meanwhile, he looked at me with such bitterness that, out of kindness, I suspected he needed divine help to digest his dinner, and his pious exclamation had no relation to my unexpected arrival. Wuthering Heights is the residence of Mr. Heathcliff. 'Wuthering' is a significant provincial adjective describing the atmospheric turbulence to which the place is subject in stormy weather. A clean and refreshing ventilation must be constantly provided above: the force of the north wind blowing overboard is indicated by the excessive leaning of some stunted fir trees at the back of the house; and by a row of thin thorns, all stretching their branches in the same direction, as if imploring the sun's alms."
"Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.' I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house' pre- eminently.","Fortunately, the architect had the foresight to build a sturdy house: the narrow windows are set deep in the wall, and the corners are protected by broad projecting stones. Before crossing the threshold, I paused to admire the abundance of grotesque carvings that dotted the facade, especially around the main entrance; above, amid a jungle of decrepit griffins and cheeky little boys, I spotted the date '1500' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw'. I wanted to make a few comments and ask the surly-tempered owner for a brief history of the property; but his attitude at the door seemed to demand my quick entry or complete departure, and I did not want to arouse his impatience before inspecting the penetrarium. A halt brought us to the family parlor, devoid of any vestibule or entrance corridor: it is here called 'home' par excellence."
"It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.","It generally comprises the kitchen and the parlor; but I believe the kitchen at Wuthering Heights is obliged to retire into another room entirely: at least, I heard a clatter of tongues and a clatter of cooking utensils at the back; and I saw no sign of roasting, boiling, or baking around the immense fireplace; nor the slightest gleam of copper pots and pewter jugs on the walls. One side, indeed, reflected beautifully the light and heat from immense rows of pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, rising row upon row on an immense oak chest of drawers, reaching to the ceiling. This last had never been signed: its whole anatomy was revealed to the inquiring eye, except where a wooden frame laden with oatcakes and bundles of beef, mutton, and legs of ham concealed it."
"Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.","Above the fireplace stood several grim-looking old rifles and a few horse pistols, and, for decoration, three colored tin cans lined the wall. The floor was of smooth white stone; the chairs, with their high backs and primitive shapes, were painted green; one or two heavy black chairs stood in the shadows. In an archway beneath the chest of drawers lay an enormous liver-colored female dog, surrounded by a flock of howling puppies; and other dogs haunted other alcoves."
"The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee- breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.","The apartment and furnishings were nothing special compared to those of a simple northern farmer, with his stubborn air and sturdy limbs, clearly visible in his breeches and leggings. Such a man, sitting in his armchair, his mug of foaming ale on the round table before him, might be seen anywhere in these hills if one happened to visit at the right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff presents a striking contrast to his home and way of life."
"He is a dark- skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling - to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.","He is a dark-skinned gypsy, a gentleman in dress and manner, that is to say, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: perhaps a little unkempt, but with his carelessness, he does not look bad, for he has a straight and elegant figure; and rather dark. Some might suspect him of a certain underdeveloped pride; I have a hunch that this is not at all the case: I know instinctively that his reserve springs from an aversion to ostentatious displays of feeling, to expressions of reciprocal kindness. He will secretly love as much as he hates, and will consider it a form of impudence to be loved or hated in return."
"No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.","No, I'm going too fast: I'm giving him too much credit for my own good qualities. Mr. Heathcliff may have reasons quite different from those which motivate me to restrain myself when meeting a potential acquaintance. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother always told me I would never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved that I was absolutely incapable of it."
"While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I 'never told my love' vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return - the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shame - shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.","While enjoying the fine weather on the coast for a month, I found myself in the company of a truly fascinating being: a veritable goddess in my eyes, as long as she paid me no attention. I never “spoke my love aloud”; yet, if looks had a language, even the smallest idiot would have guessed that I was in over my head: she finally understood me and looked at me—the sweetest look imaginable. And what did I do? I confess it with shame: I shrank, frozen, like a snail; with every glance, I felt colder and colder; until finally, the poor innocent woman began to doubt her own sanity and, overcome by her supposed mistake, persuaded her mother to leave."
"By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate. I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl. 'You'd better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. 'She's not accustomed to be spoiled - not kept for a pet.' Then, striding to a side door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!' Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me VIS-A-VIS the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.","This curious turn of events has earned me a reputation for deliberate cruelty; how unjustified it was, only I can see. I sat down at the end of the hearth, opposite the one my owner was approaching, and took advantage of a moment's silence to attempt to stroke the dog, which had left its nursery and was prowling like a wolf towards the back of my legs, lip curled and white teeth bared. My caress brought out a long, guttural growl. ""Leave the dog alone,"" growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, quelling his outbursts with a kick. ""She is not used to being petted, nor to being kept like a pet."" Then, going to a side door, he called again, ""Joseph!"" "" Joseph murmured indistinctly from the depths of the cellar, but made no move to come up; Then his master sprang upon him, leaving me to face the ferocious female dog and two grim, shaggy sheepdogs, who shared with her a jealous watch over my every move."
"Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.","Having no intention of making contact with their fangs, I sat silently; but, thinking they would find it difficult to understand silent insults, I unfortunately yielded to winks and grimaces addressed to the trio. An aberration in my features so irritated Madame that she burst into a rage and jumped onto my knee. I threw her back and hastened to push the table between us. This action threw the whole group into a frenzy: half a dozen four-legged demons, of various sizes and ages, sprang out of hidden caves in the common center."
"I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace. Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene. 'What the devil is the matter?' he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment. 'What the devil, indeed!' I muttered. 'The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.","I felt my heels and tails like strange targets for attack; and while I fended off the more imposing combatants as best I could with the poker, I felt obliged to loudly implore some of the housemates for help in restoring peace. Mr. Heathcliff and his servant mounted the cellar stairs with an embarrassing drool: I don't think they moved a second faster than usual, though the fireplace was a perfect storm of moans and grunts. Fortunately, an inhabitant of the kitchen was more hasty: a voluptuous lady, with tucked-up dress, bare arms, and flushed cheeks, burst in between us, brandishing a frying pan. She used this weapon, and her tongue, with such determination that the storm abated as if by magic, and she was left alone, tossed like a sea in a violent wind, when her master arrived. ""What the devil is going on?"" he asked, looking at me with a look I could hardly bear after this inhospitable treatment. ""What the devil, really!"" I murmured. ""That herd of possessed pigs couldn't have had a worse mind than yours, sir."""
"You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!' 'They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. 'The dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?' 'No, thank you.' 'Not bitten, are you?' 'If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.' Heathcliff's countenance relaxed into a grin. 'Come, come,' he said, 'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a little wine.","'Might as well leave a stranger with a pack of tigers!' 'They don't bother with people who don't touch anything,' he observed, placing the bottle before me and straightening the table. 'The dogs had better be vigilant. A glass of wine?' 'No, thank you.' 'Not bitten, eh?' 'If I had been, I'd have put my seal on the biter.' Heathcliff's face relaxed into a smile. 'Now, now,' he said, 'you're excited, Mr. Lockwood. Here, have a little wine.'"
"Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your health, sir?' I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his humour took that turn. He - probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant - relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me, - a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.","Guests are so rare in this house that my dogs and I, I freely confess, hardly know how to receive them. ""To your health, sir?"" I bowed and returned my promise. I began to realize that it would be foolish to sulk over the unseemly behavior of a pack of stray dogs. Besides, I was hardly inclined to grant this man any further entertainment at my expense, his temper having taken this turn. He—probably influenced by a cautious reflection on the folly of insulting a good tenant—relaxed a little in his laconic style of truncating his pronouns and auxiliaries, and introduced what he thought would be a topic of interest to me: a treatise on the advantages and disadvantages of my present lodgings."
"I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go, notwithstanding.","I found him very intelligent on the topics discussed; and before I left, I was encouraged to come back tomorrow. He obviously didn't want me to come back. I'm going anyway."
"It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him. YESTERDAY afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights.","It's amazing how sociable I feel compared to him. Yesterday afternoon was cold and foggy. I almost wanted to spend my afternoon by the fire in my study, rather than wading through heather and mud to Wuthering Heights."
"On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B. - I dine between twelve and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five) - on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk, arrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow-shower. On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb.","However, when I got up after dinner (NB: I dine between twelve and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a lady-in-waiting, considered a regular at the house, could not or would not understand my request to be served at five o'clock), when, with this nonchalant intention, I mounted the stairs and entered the room, I saw a maid on her knees, surrounded by brooms and coal bins, raising an infernal cloud of dust by smothering the flames with piles of embers. This sight immediately revolted me; I took my hat, and after a four-mile walk, I arrived at the gate of Heathcliff's garden, just in time to escape the first flakes of a snowstorm. On that bare hill, the earth was hard with black frost, and the air made me shiver all over."
"Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled. 'Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated, mentally, 'you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don't care - I will get in!' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.","Unable to unfasten the chain, I jumped over it and ran up the cobbled embankment, lined with gooseberry bushes. I knocked in vain for permission to enter, until my joints tingled and the dogs howled. “Filthy inhabitants!” I cried to myself. “You deserve eternal isolation for your gross inhospitality. At least I wouldn’t leave my doors locked during the day. No matter, I’ll get in!” Determined, I grabbed the latch and shook it vigorously."
"Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn. 'What are ye for?' he shouted. 'T' maister's down i' t' fowld. Go round by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.' 'Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively. 'There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer flaysome dins till neeght.' 'Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?' 'Nor-ne me! I'll hae no hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing. The snow began to drive thickly.","Joseph, looking winey, poked his head out of a round window in the barn. ""What are you for?"" he called. ""The teacher is downstairs. Go through the door if you want to speak to him."" ""Is there no one to open it?"" I answered. ""There is no one, except the teacher; she refuses to open it, and you'll make your filthy racket until you have to."" ""Why? You can't tell her who I am, can you, Joseph?"" ""Me neither! I don't want to,"" murmured the head as it disappeared. The snow was getting deep."
"I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected.","I grasped the latch to try again; a young man, coatless and holding a pitchfork, then appeared in the courtyard behind me. He beckoned me to follow him, and after passing through a wash-house and a paved area containing a coal shed, a pump, and a dovecote, we finally arrived at the immense, warm, and welcoming apartment where I had been received previously. It glowed delightfully in the light of a huge fire, made of embers, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a sumptuous dinner, I saw, to my great joy, the ""mistress,"" a person whose existence I had never known."
"I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute. 'Rough weather!' I remarked. 'I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.' She never opened her mouth. I stared - she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable. 'Sit down,' said the young man, gruffly. 'He'll be in soon.' I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance. 'A beautiful animal!' I commenced again. 'Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?' 'They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied. 'Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats. 'A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.","I bowed and waited, thinking she would ask me to sit down. She looked at me, leaned back in her chair, and remained motionless and silent. ""Bad weather!"" I remarked. ""I fear, Mrs. Heathcliff, that the door may suffer the consequences of the inconsiderate presence of your servants: I have done all I could to make them hear me."" She remained silent. I stared at her—and at least she kept her eyes fixed on me coldly and carelessly, in a most embarrassing and disagreeable manner. ""Sit down,"" said the young man gruffly. ""He will be here presently."" I obeyed, nodded, and called to wicked Juno, who, during this second conversation, deigned to wag the tip of her tail in recognition. ""A fine animal!"" I resumed. ""Do you intend to part with the little ones, madam?"" ""They are not mine,"" said the kind landlady, in a tone more repugnant than Heathcliff himself could have managed. ""Ah, are your favorites among them?"" I continued, turning to a dark pillow covered with what looked like cats. ""A strange choice of favorites!"" she remarked disdainfully."
"Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening. 'You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters. Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance.","Unfortunately, it was a pile of dead rabbits. I made another detour and approached the fireplace, repeating my remark about the violence of the evening. ""You shouldn't have gone out,"" she said, getting up and taking two painted tin cans from the mantelpiece. She had previously been shielded from the light; now I had a clear view of her whole figure and face."
"She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold. 'I don't want your help,' she snapped; 'I can get them for myself.' 'I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply. 'Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot. 'I shall be glad to have a cup,' I answered. 'Were you asked?' she repeated. 'No,' I said, half smiling. 'You are the proper person to ask me.' She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's ready to cry. Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us.","She was slim, and seemed scarcely out of her youth: an admirable figure, and the most delicate face I have ever had the pleasure of contemplating; fine, very fair features; blond, or rather golden, curls hanging loosely around her delicate neck; and eyes, if they had held a pleasing expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my sensitive heart, the only feelings they expressed oscillated between contempt and a sort of despair, very unnatural to detect in them. Her glance was almost beyond her reach; I made a gesture to help her; she turned to me as a miser would turn to me if someone attempted to help him count his gold. ""I don't want your help,"" she said sharply; ""I can go and get it myself."" ""Excuse me!"" I hastened to reply. ""Are you invited to tea?"" "" she asked, tying an apron over her crisp black dress and standing over the teapot with a spoon on the tray. ""I'd like a cup of tea,"" I replied. ""Have you been invited?"" she repeated. ""No,"" I said with a half-smile. ""You have to ask me."" She threw back the tea, spoon included, and sat back in her chair like a cat; her brow furrowed and her red lower lip swelling, like a child about to cry. Meanwhile, the young man had wrapped himself in a rather threadbare outer garment and, straightening himself before the flames, looked at me out of the corner of his eye, as if a deadly quarrel were raging between us."
"I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state. 'You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!' I exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; 'and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter during that space.' 'Half an hour?' he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; 'I wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in. Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.' 'Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the Grange till morning - could you spare me one?' 'No, I could not.' 'Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.' 'Umph!' 'Are you going to mak' the tea?' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady. 'Is HE to have any?' she asked, appealing to Heathcliff. 'Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, uttered so savagely that I started.","I began to doubt whether he was a servant: his dress and speech were coarse, devoid of all the superiority characteristic of Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers curled insolently over his cheeks, and his hands were tanned like a common workman's; yet his manner was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of the diligence of a servant to the lady of the house. Having no clear indication of his condition, I thought it best to ignore his strange behavior; and five minutes later, Heathcliff's entrance relieved me somewhat of my uneasiness. ""You see, sir, I came as promised!"" I exclaimed cheerfully; ""and I fear I shall be exposed to the weather for half an hour, if you can shelter me during that time."" ""Half an hour?"" "" he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; I wonder if you should choose the thickest snowstorm to walk in. Do you know you might get lost in the marshes? Those who know these moors often get lost on such nights; and I can tell you there is no chance of change at the moment. ""Perhaps I could find a guide among your boys, who could stay at the Grange until tomorrow. Could you provide me with one?"" ""No, I can't."" ""Oh, really! Well, then I must trust to my wits."" ""Phew!"" ""Are you going to make tea?"" he asked the shabby coat, turning his fierce gaze from me to the young woman. ""Is he going to have tea too?"" she asked, imploring Heathcliff. ""Make it, will you?"" was his reply, so abrupt that I started."
"The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow. When the preparations were finished, he invited me with - 'Now, sir, bring forward your chair.' And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.","The tone of his voice betrayed real malice. I no longer felt the need to call Heathcliff a great man. Once the preparations were complete, he invited me: ""Now, sir, move your chair forward."" And all of us, including the uncouth young man, gathered around the table: a severe silence reigned as we discussed our meal."
"I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their every-day countenance. 'It is strange,' I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another - 'it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, I'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart - ' 'My amiable lady!' he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his face. 'Where is she - my amiable lady?' 'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.' 'Well, yes - oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone. Is that it?' Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.","I thought that if I had caused this cloud, it was my duty to try to dispel it. They could not remain so gloomy and silent every day; and it was impossible, however gloomy they might be, that their general frown should be their daily expression. 'It is strange,' I began between cups of tea, 'it is strange how habit can mould our tastes and ideas: many would not imagine happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as yours, Mr. Heathcliff; yet I dare say, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable wife as the ruling spirit of your hearth and heart—' 'My amiable wife!' he interrupted with a smile almost evil. 'Where is she, my amiable wife?' 'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.' » “Well… oh, one might suggest that his spirit took on the role of a guardian angel, watching over the fate of Wuthering Heights even after his body disappeared. Is that right?” I felt I had made a mistake and tried to correct it."
"I might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.","I should have noticed that the age difference between the two was too great to make it likely that they were a man and a woman. One was in his forties: a period of mental fortitude when men rarely entertain the illusion of having married a woman for love; we reserve that fantasy for the comfort of our later years. The other didn't look seventeen."
"Then it flashed on me - 'The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his broad with unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity - I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice.' The last reflection may seem conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive. 'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' said Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise.","Then a thought occurred to me: 'The clown next to me, drinking his tea from a bowl and eating his wife without washing his hands, could be her husband: Heathcliff Jr., of course. That's the consequence of being buried alive: she gave herself up to that peasant out of sheer ignorance that better people existed! Too bad! I must be careful not to make her regret her choice.' This last thought might have sounded pretentious, but it wasn't. My neighbor seemed almost repulsive to me; I knew from experience that I was rather attractive. 'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' Heathcliff said, confirming my suspicions."
"He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul. 'Ah, certainly - I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy,' I remarked, turning to my neighbour. This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice. 'Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' observed my host; 'we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.","As he spoke, he looked at her with a strange expression: a look of hatred; unless he possessed a most perverse facial muscle, incapable, like those of others, of interpreting the language of her soul. ""Ah, certainly... I understand now: you are the privileged possessor of the benevolent fairy,"" I remarked, turning to my neighbor. It was worse than before: the young man blushed and clenched his fist, seeming to attack deliberately. But he seemed to recover quickly and stifled the storm with a cruel oath, which he muttered in my name, but which I carefully ignored. ""Your suspicions are unfortunate, sir,"" my host remarked; ""none of us has the privilege of recognizing your good fairy; her companion is dead."""
"I said she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.' 'And this young man is - ' 'Not my son, assuredly.' Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him. 'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the other; 'and I'd counsel you to respect it!' 'I've shown no disrespect,' was my reply, laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself. He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.","I said she was my daughter-in-law: so she must have married my son. —And this young man is——“ “Not my son, absolutely not.” Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were too impudent a joke to attribute the paternity of this boy to him. “My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I advise you to respect that!” “I meant no disrespect to him,” I replied, laughing inwardly at the dignity with which he had introduced himself. He looked at me longer than I bothered to return his glance, for fear I should be tempted to slap him or give any hint of amusement. I began to feel distinctly out of place in this pleasant family circle."
"The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time. The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow. 'I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I could not help exclaiming. 'The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.' 'Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.","The dark spiritual atmosphere overwhelmed, and more than completely, the radiant physical comfort that surrounded me; I therefore decided to be cautious in venturing beneath those beams for the third time. After the meal, and when no one had exchanged a pleasant word, I went to a window to observe the weather. I saw a dismal sight: black night was falling prematurely, and the sky and hills were mingling in a whirl of icy wind and suffocating snow. ""I don't think I can get back without a guide now,"" I could not help exclaiming. ""The roads are already clear; and if they were, I could hardly see a foot."" ""Hareton, get those twelve sheep into the barn."""
"They'll be covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,' said Heathcliff. 'How must I do?' I continued, with rising irritation. There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out - 'Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i' idleness un war, when all on 'ems goan out! Bud yah're a nowt, and it's no use talking - yah'll niver mend o'yer ill ways, but goa raight to t' divil, like yer mother afore ye!' I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door.","""They'll be covered if they stay in the fold all night; and if a board is put in front of them,"" said Heathcliff. ""How can we do that?"" I continued, my irritation increasing. There was no answer to my question; and when I turned around, I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of gruel for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff stooping over the fire, amusing herself by burning a packet of matches that had fallen from the chimney, while she replaced the tea-box. The former, having laid down his burden, looked critically around the room, and called out in a hoarse voice, ""It's a wonder you can force yourself to stay here, for heaven's sake, when everyone's chasing them! But you're nothing, and it's no good talking; you'll never change your bad habits; you'll go straight to the devil, like your mother before you!"" ""I thought for a moment that this eloquent word was addressed to me. I ran angrily towards the old scoundrel, with the intention of throwing him out."
"Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer. 'You scandalous old hypocrite!' she replied. 'Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name? I warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,' she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; 'I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The red cow didn't die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations!' 'Oh, wicked, wicked!' gasped the elder; 'may the Lord deliver us from evil!' 'No, reprobate! you are a castaway - be off, or I'll hurt you seriously! I'll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the limits I fix shall - I'll not say what he shall be done to - but, you'll see! Go, I'm looking at you!' The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and ejaculating 'wicked' as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress. 'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said earnestly, 'you must excuse me for troubling you.","Mrs. Heathcliff, however, interrupted me abruptly. ""You scandalous old hypocrite!"" she retorted. ""Aren't you afraid of being literally swept away every time you mention the Devil's name? I warn you not to provoke me, or I shall ask for your removal as a special favor! Stop! Look, Joseph,"" she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; ""I will show you how far I have progressed in the Dark Art: I shall soon be able to attend to it. The red cow did not die by chance; and your rheumatism is far from being attributable to Providence!"" ""Oh, wicked, wicked!"" gasped the elder; ""the Lord deliver us from evil!"" ""No, wicked! You are a castaway—go away, or I will hurt you terribly! I will have you sculpted in wax and clay!"" ""And the first one who oversteps the bounds I have set—I won't say what will happen to him—but you'll see! Come on, I'm watching you!"" The little witch wore mock malice in her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with genuine horror, rushed out praying and crying ""Wicked fellow!"" I thought his behavior must be inspired by some sort of sad amusement; and now that we were alone, I tried to interest him in my grief. ""Mrs. Heathcliff,"" I said gravely, ""you must forgive me for disturbing you."
"I presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to London!' 'Take the road you came,' she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before her. 'It is brief advice, but as sound as I can give.' 'Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow, your conscience won't whisper that it is partly your fault?' 'How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn't let me go to the end of the garden wall.' 'YOU! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night,' I cried. 'I want you to tell me my way, not to SHOW it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.' 'Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.","I suppose so, for with that face I'm sure you can't help being kind. Show me some landmarks that will enable me to find my way back: I no more know how to get there than you know how to get to London!' 'Take the way you came,' she replied, settling into an armchair with a candle before her, the big book open. 'It's brief advice, but as good as I can give you. So, if you hear that I've been found dead in a bog or a snow pit, won't your conscience whisper to you that it's partly your fault?' 'Why? I can't go with you. They wouldn't let me go to the end of the garden wall.' 'YOU! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold on a night like this, for my convenience,' I cried. I want you to point out the way, not show me the way: otherwise, Mr. Heathcliff will persuade me to give him a guide. — Who? Here he is, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph, and me."
"Which would you have?' 'Are there no boys at the farm?' 'No; those are all.' 'Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.' 'That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.' 'I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills,' cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance. 'As to staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.' 'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied. 'No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!' said the unmannerly wretch. With this insult my patience was at an end.","Which do you prefer? 'Are there no boys at the farm?' 'No, they all are.' 'Then it follows that I am obliged to stay.' 'So that you may settle your accounts with your host. I had nothing to do with it.' 'I hope this will be a lesson to you: make no more rash incursions into these hills!' called Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen door. 'As for staying here, I reserve no spare room: you will have to share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you wish.' 'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied. 'No, no! A stranger is a stranger, whether rich or poor: it does not become me to let anyone explore the place while I am on my guard!' said the wretch. This insult tried my patience to the limit."
"I uttered an expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend me. 'I'll go with him as far as the park,' he said. 'You'll go with him to hell!' exclaimed his master, or whatever relation he bore. 'And who is to look after the horses, eh?' 'A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the horses: somebody must go,' murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected. 'Not at your command!' retorted Hareton. 'If you set store on him, you'd better be quiet.' 'Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,' she answered, sharply. 'Hearken, hearken, shoo's cursing on 'em!' muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been steering.","I gave a look of disgust and passed him into the garden, joining Earnshaw in my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the exit; and, as I strolled along, I overheard another instance of their mutual politeness. At first, the young man seemed about to make friends with me. ""I'll go with him to the park,"" he said. ""You'll go to hell with him!"" exclaimed his master, or his family, whoever they were. ""And who will look after the horses, then?"" ""A man's life is worth more than an evening's neglect of horses: somebody must go,"" murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more gently than I expected. ""Not on your orders!"" rejoined Hareton. ""If you're going after him, you'd better keep quiet."" ""Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff never has another tenant before the Grange is in ruins,"" she retorted sharply. ""Listen, listen, they're cursing you!"" whispered Joseph, where I had run."
"He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern. 'Maister, maister, he's staling t' lanthern!' shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat. 'Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him, holld him!' On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out on their peril to keep me one minute longer - with several incoherent threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear. The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.","He was milking the cows within earshot, by the light of a lantern, which I seized without hesitation. Shouting that I would send him away the next day, I rushed to the nearest back door. ""Master, master, he's hanging up the lantern!"" cried the old man, continuing my retreat. ""Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey, Wolf, stop him!"" As I opened the little door, two hairy monsters sprang at my throat, dragged me to the ground, and put out the light. The mingled laughter of Heathcliff and Hareton crowned my rage and humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more inclined to stretch out their paws, yawn, and wag their tails than to devour me alive; but they refused to revive, and I was forced to lie there until their wicked masters came and freed me. Then, hatless and trembling with rage, I ordered the villains to release me at their peril and to detain me a minute longer, with various incoherent threats of reprisal which, in their indeterminate virulence, recalled King Lear. The violence of my excitement made my nose bleed, and Heathcliff continued to laugh, while I continued to swear."
"I don't know what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel. 'Well, Mr. Earnshaw,' she cried, 'I wonder what you'll have agait next? Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house will never do for me - look at t' poor lad, he's fair choking! Wisht, wisht; you mun'n't go on so.","I don't know what the scene would have been like if someone more rational and kind than my host had not been present. It was Zillah, the stout housekeeper, who at last came out to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought some of them had seized me violently; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery on the young rascal. ""Now, Mr. Earnshaw,"" she cried, ""I wonder what you are up to? Are we going to murder people on our own doorstep? I see I shall never like this house! Look at that poor fellow, he's almost suffocating! Please, please! You can't go on like this."""
"Come in, and I'll cure that: there now, hold ye still.' With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness. I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof.","""Come in, I'll remedy that: here, be quiet."" With that, she suddenly splashed a pint of iced water on my neck and dragged me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed her, his accidental cheerfulness quickly turning into his usual gloom. I felt violently sick, dizzy, and faint; I was therefore compelled to remain with him."
"He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed. WHILE leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason.","He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, then went to the inner chamber. While offering me her condolences, and after following her orders, which had somewhat improved my condition, she escorted me to the bed. As she led me upstairs, she advised me to hide the candle and not make a noise, for her master had a strange idea concerning the room in which she would place me and never let anyone stay there of their own free will. I asked her the reason."
"She did not know, she answered: she had only lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not begin to be curious. Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows.","She didn't know, she replied: she had only lived there for a year or two; and so many strange things were happening there that she couldn't even realize it. Too stunned to be stunned myself, I closed my door and looked at the bed. The interior consisted of a chair, a clothes closet, and a large oak wardrobe with carved squares on the top that looked like carriage windows."
"Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch, very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.","As I approached this structure, I peered inside and saw that it was a curious sort of old-fashioned bench, cleverly designed to save each member of the family from having a room of their own. It formed, in fact, a small closet, and the window-sill it surrounded served as a table. I pushed back the panels, went in with my lamp, closed them, and felt safe from the vigilance of Heathcliff and all the others."
"The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters, large and small - CATHERINE EARNSHAW, here and there varied to CATHERINE HEATHCLIFF, and then again to CATHERINE LINTON. In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw Heathcliff - Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres - the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.","The ledge where I had placed my candle was crowded with musty books in one corner; it was covered with writing scrawled in the paint. This writing, however, was nothing but a name, repeated in all sorts of letters, large and small: CATHERINE EARNSHAW, alternating here and there with CATHERINE HEATHCLIFF, and then again with CATHERINE LINTON. In icy apathy, I leaned my head against the window and went on spelling Catherine Earnshaw Heathcliff–Linton, until my eyes closed; but they had not been silent five minutes when a glitter of white letters sprang up from the darkness, as vivid as ghosts—the air teemed with Catherine; and when I tried to banish that indiscreet name, I discovered that the wick of my candle was resting on one of the old books, perfuming the place with the scent of toasted calfskin."
"I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the inscription - 'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.","I blew it out and, feeling very ill with a cold and persistent nausea, sat up and spread the battered book across my knee. It was a will, written in small letters, and it smelled terribly musty. A flyleaf bore the inscription 'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date a quarter of a century ago. I closed it and took out another, and another, until I had examined everything."
"Catherine's library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary - at least the appearance of one covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, rudely, yet powerfully sketched.","Catherine's library was of good quality, and its dilapidated condition proved that it had been well used, if not exclusively for legitimate purposes: hardly a chapter escaped her, a pen-and-ink commentary—or at least a semblance of one—filling every blank left by the printer. Some sections consisted of isolated sentences; others seemed like a simple diary entry, scrawled in clumsy, childish handwriting. At the top of an extra page (probably a treasure trove, for all I know), I discovered to my delight an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, crudely but powerfully drawn."
"An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics. 'An awful Sunday,' commenced the paragraph beneath. 'I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute - his conduct to Heathcliff is atrocious - H. and I are going to rebel - we took our initiatory step this evening. 'All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire - doing anything but reading their Bibles, I'll answer for it - Heathcliff, myself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us descending, ""What, done already?"" On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners. '""You forget you have a master here,"" says the tyrant. ""I'll demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence.","My interest in the unknown Catherine was immediately piqued, and I set about deciphering her faded hieroglyphs. ""A dreadful Sunday,"" began the next paragraph. ""I wish my father were back. Hindley is a loathsome substitute—his behavior toward Heathcliff is abominable—H. and I shall rebel—we have taken our first step tonight."" It had rained heavily all day; we could not go to church, so Joseph was forced to hold a service in the attic; and while Hindley and his wife lounged downstairs before a warm fire—doing everything except read their Bibles, I vouch for that—Heathcliff, I, and the unfortunate ploughman were ordered to lay down our prayer books and mount our horses: we were lined up, groaning and shivering, on a sack of grain, in the hope that Joseph would also tremble so that he could give us a short sermon. Vain imagination! The service lasted exactly three hours; yet my brother had the nerve to exclaim when he saw us coming down, ""What, it's over already?"" On Sunday evenings, we were allowed to play as long as we didn't make too much noise; today, a laugh is enough to corner us. ""You forget that you have a master here,"" said the tyrant. ""I'll kill anyone who gets in my way! I demand absolute sobriety and silence."""
"Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you go by: I heard him snap his fingers."" Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated herself on her husband's knee, and there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour - foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph, on an errand from the stables.","Oh dear! Was that you? Frances, darling, pull his hair as you pass: I heard her snapping her fingers. Frances pulled his hair enthusiastically, then sat on her husband's lap, and they stayed there like two babies, kissing for hours and talking nonsense—nonsense we would have been ashamed of. We made ourselves as comfortable as possible under the vault of the chest of drawers. I had just tied our aprons together and hung them up as a curtain when Joseph came in to run an errand in the stable."
"He tears down my handiwork, boxes my ears, and croaks: '""T' maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o'ered, und t' sound o' t' gospel still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye down, ill childer! there's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em: sit ye down, and think o' yer sowls!"" 'Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog- kennel, vowing I hated a good book.","He tears up my work, hits me on the ears, and groans: ""The Master is barely buried, the Sabbath is not yet over, and the Gospel is still ringing in your ears, and you should be ashamed! Shame on you! Sit down, sick child! There are enough good books if you want to read them: Sit down and think of your soul!"" With these words, he forced us to sit so that we could receive a faint ray of the distant fire, which would reveal the text of the wood he had forced upon us. I could not bear the effort. I snatched my filthy book from the synagogue and threw it into the niche, vowing that I hate good books."
"Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub! '""Maister Hindley!"" shouted our chaplain. "" Maister, coom hither! Miss Cathy's riven th' back off 'Th' Helmet o' Salvation,' un' Heathcliff's pawsed his fit into t' first part o' 'T' Brooad Way to Destruction!' It's fair flaysome that ye let 'em go on this gait. Ech! th' owd man wad ha' laced 'em properly - but he's goan!"" 'Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, ""owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.","Heathcliff stamped his foot on the same spot. Suddenly there was a commotion! ""Master Hindley!"" our chaplain called. ""Master, come here! Miss Cathy has torn off the rim of the 'Helm of Salvation,' and Heathcliff has stuck his paw into the first part of 'The Road to Destruction'!"" It's absolutely ridiculous to let them escape like that. Yes! The old man tied them up carefully, but he's gone!"" Hindley rushed out of his fireplace paradise, grabbed one by the collar, the other by the arm, and threw us both into the scullery. Joseph assured him, ""Old Nick would surely come for us."" Thus reassured, we each found a secluded spot to wait for him."
"I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman's cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant suggestion - and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his prophecy verified - we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we are here.' ****** I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up another subject: she waxed lachrymose. 'How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!' she wrote. 'My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can't give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and won't let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders.","I took this book and an inkstand from a shelf, opened the front door a crack to admit light, and have been writing for twenty minutes; but my companion grows impatient, and suggests we take the milkmaid's coat and run out onto the heath under the lean-to. A nice suggestion—and when the old curmudgeon comes in, he may think his prophecy is true—we can't be wetter or colder than here in the rain. ****** I suppose Catherine carried out her plan, for the next sentence was on a different subject: She began to cry. 'How little I thought Hindley would ever make me cry like this!' she wrote. 'My head aches until I can't keep it down on my pillow; and yet I cannot stop. Poor Heathcliff!' Hindley calls him a tramp and won't let him sit or eat with us anymore; and he says he and I have no right to play together and threatens to throw him out of the house if we disobey his instructions."
"He has been blaming our father (how dared he?) for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right place - ' ****** I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from manuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title - 'Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the Seventy-First.' A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.' And while I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don't remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.","He accused our father (how dare he?) of treating H. too generously and swears to put him in his place."" ****** I began to nod sleepily over the dark page; my gaze wandered from the manuscript to the print. My eye fell on a red-embellished heading: ""Seventy times seven and the first of the seventy-first."" A pious discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabez Branderham in the chapel of Gimmerden Sough. And while I was half-consciously wondering what Jabez Branderham would think of his subject, I sank back into bed and fell asleep. Woe to the bad tea and the bad temper! What could have given me such a dreadful night? I cannot remember a night like it, for I was capable of suffering."
"I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be so denominated.","I began to dream almost before I even noticed my surroundings. I thought it was morning and I had returned home with Joseph as my guide. The snow piled up meters across our path; and as we stumbled along, my companion continually reproached me for not having a pilgrim's staff with me: Without it, I would never get into the house, and he boasted about a cumbersome club, which, I understood, also bore his name."
"For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text - 'Seventy Times Seven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the 'First of the Seventy-First,' and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.","For a moment, I thought it absurd that such a weapon would be needed to get into my house. Then a new idea came to me. I wouldn't go: we were going to hear Jabez Branderham's famous sermon, taken from the text ""Seventy Times Seven""; and either Joseph the Preacher or I had committed the ""First of the Seventy-One"" and would be publicly denounced and excommunicated."
"We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.","We reached the chapel. I passed it two or three times on my walks; it lies in a hollow between two hills, a raised hollow, near a marsh whose peat juice is said to be used to embalm the few corpses lying there. The roof has so far remained intact; but since a minister's annual salary is only twenty pounds, and a two-room house can quickly be converted into one, no minister will assume the duties of a vicar, especially since his congregation, it is said, would rather let him starve than supplement their income with a penny from his pocket."
"However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached - good God! what a sermon; divided into FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY parts, each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.","But in my dream, Jabez had a large and attentive congregation; and he preached—my God! What a sermon! It was divided into 430 sections, each identical to a classic pulpit, and each section dealt with a different sin! Where he got them, I don't know. He had his own way of interpreting the sentence, and it seemed necessary that the brother commit different sins on each occasion. They were of a most remarkable nature: strange transgressions on a scale I had never before imagined."
"Oh, how weary I grow. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would EVER have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the 'FIRST OF THE SEVENTY-FIRST.' At that crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon. 'Sir,' I exclaimed, 'sitting here within these four walls, at one stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse.","Oh, how tired I am! How I have writhed, yawned, nodded, and come to my senses again! How I have pinched myself, pricked myself, rubbed my eyes, gotten up, sat down again, and nudged Joseph to tell me if he had ever done anything. I had to listen to everything until he finally came to ""THE FIRST OF THE SEVENTY-ONE."" At this crucial moment, a sudden inspiration came over me; I stood up and condemned Jabez Branderham as the culprit of a sin for which no Christian needs forgiveness. ""Lord,"" I cried, ""sitting here within these four walls, I have, at one fell swoop, endured and forgiven all four hundred and ninety points of your argument."""
"Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to depart - Seventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down, and crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!' 'THOU ART THE MAN!' cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his cushion. 'Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage - seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul - Lo, this is human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the Seventy-First is come.","Seventy times seven I took my hat and wanted to leave. Seventy times seven you ridiculously forced me back into my place. Four hundred and ninety-one is too many. Comrade martyrs, seize him! Tear him to the ground and smash him, so that the place that knows him will no longer recognize him! ""YOU ARE THE MAN!"" cried Jabez after a solemn pause, leaning back on his pillow. Seventy times seven her face twisted. Seventy times seven I spoke to my soul. See, this is human weakness: this too can be forgiven! The first of the seventy-one has arrived."
"Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.","Brothers, execute the sentence written against him. What honor is due to all his saints!"" At these words, the entire assembly, brandishing their pilgrim staffs, pressed around me in crowds; and I, without a weapon for defense, began to wrestle for Joseph, my nearest and fiercest attacker, in his cause. Several clubs crossed in the crowd; the blows aimed at me struck other candlesticks."
"Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez's part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than before. This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also, the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.","Soon the whole chapel echoed with blows and counter-blows: each rose against his neighbor; and Branderham, refusing to keep still, gave vent to his fury in a flurry of violent blows on the pulpit boards, which reacted so quickly that they finally awakened me, to my unspeakable relief. And what had caused this uproar? What part had Jabez played in this quarrel? Merely a pine branch brushing my trellis while the wind howled, its dry pine cones rattling against the panes! I listened doubtfully for a moment; I spotted the troublemaker, then turned over, dozed off, and dreamed again: if possible even more unpleasantly than before. This time I remembered that I was lying in the oak chamber, and I distinctly heard the gusts and the passing wind; I also heard the pine branch repeating its teasing cry and attributed this to the precise cause. But it irritated me so much that I decided to silence the noise if possible. I told myself: I'll get up and try to loosen the window frame."
"The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when awake, but forgotten. 'I must stop it, nevertheless!' I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in - let me in!' 'Who are you?' I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself. 'Catherine Linton,' it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of LINTON? I had read EARNSHAW twenty times for Linton) - 'I'm come home: I'd lost my way on the moor!' As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, 'Let me in!' and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening me with fear. 'How can I!' I said at length. 'Let ME go, if you want me to let you in!' The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on! 'Begone!' I shouted. 'I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.' 'It is twenty years,' mourned the voice: 'twenty years.","The hook was welded to the staple: a detail I had noticed upon waking, but which I had forgotten. ""I must stop!"" I muttered, cracking my knuckles through the glass and reaching out to grasp the offending branch; instead, my fingers closed around those of a small, icy hand! The intense terror of a nightmare came over me: I tried to withdraw my arm, but the small hand seized it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed, ""Let me in! Let me in!"" ""Who are you?"" I asked, struggling to free myself. ""Catherine Linton,"" she answered tremblingly (why did I think of LINTON? I had read Linton to EARNSHAW twenty times)—""I came in: I was lost on the moor!"" As she spoke, I saw dimly the face of a child looking out of the window. Fear made me cruel; And since it seemed useless to shake the creature, I pulled her wrist across the broken windowpane and rubbed it back and forth until the blood dripped out and soaked the bedspread. She moaned incessantly, ""Let me in!"" and her screams never stopped, driving me almost mad with fear. ""How can I?"" I finally said. ""Let ME go if you want me to let you in!"" Her fingers went limp, I pulled mine through the hole, hastily stacked the books against her in a pyramid, and covered my ears to drown out the plaintive prayer. It seemed to me as if I had closed them for a quarter of an hour; but as soon as I listened again, I heard the plaintive cry ringing out over and over again! ""Go away!"" I cried. ""I'll never let you in, even if you beg for 20 years."" ""20 years,"" the voice groaned, ""20 years."""
"I've been a waif for twenty years!' Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.","""I've been a vagabond for twenty years!"" Then there was a faint scratching sound outside, and the stack of books shifted as if it had been pushed. I tried to get up, but couldn't move a limb; so, seized by fear, I cried out loudly. To my surprise, I found that this cry wasn't exactly pleasant: Hurried footsteps approached my bedroom door; someone pushed it open with a strong hand, and a light shone through the panes at the head of the bed."
"I sat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself. At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, 'Is any one here?' I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff's accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet. With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.","I was still shivering and wiping the sweat from my brow. The intruder seemed to hesitate, muttering to himself. Finally, he asked quietly, apparently without waiting for an answer, ""Is anyone here?"" I thought it best to make my presence known, for I knew Heathcliff's accent and was afraid he would stop looking for me if I remained silent. With that in mind, I turned around and opened the doors."
"I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced. Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up. 'It is only your guest, sir,' I called out, desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. 'I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.","I won't soon forget the effect of my gesture. Heathcliff stood in the doorway, shirtless and breeches in hand, a candle dripping over his fingers, his face as pale as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak tree made him jump like an electric shock: the light radiated several meters from his hand, and his excitement was so great that he could barely contain it. ""It's only your guest, sir,"" I cried, to spare him the humiliation of further revealing his cowardice. ""I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, due to a terrible nightmare."""
"I'm sorry I disturbed you.' 'Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the - ' commenced my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it steady. 'And who showed you up into this room?' he continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. 'Who was it? I've a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment?' 'It was your servant Zillah,' I replied, flinging myself on to the floor, and rapidly resuming my garments. 'I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it is - swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up, I assure you.","""I'm sorry to have disturbed you."" ""Oh, damn it, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were here..."" my host began, placing the candle on a chair, unable to keep it upright. ""And who let you into this room?"" he continued, digging his nails into his palms and gritting his teeth to suppress the spasms in his upper jaw. ""Who did it? I intend to have her thrown out immediately?"" ""It was your servant Zillah,"" I replied, throwing myself onto the floor and hastily getting dressed again. ""I wouldn't have taken offense, Mr. Heathcliff; she deserved it. I suppose she wanted further proof that this place is haunted, at my expense. But it's true, it's crawling with ghosts and goblins! You have every reason to lock it up, I assure you."""
"No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!' 'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, 'and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night, since you ARE here; but, for heaven's sake! don't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were having your throat cut!' 'If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have strangled me!' I returned. 'I'm not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham akin to you on the mother's side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was called - she must have been a changeling - wicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal transgressions, I've no doubt!' Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely slipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to add - 'The truth is, sir, I passed the first part of the night in - ' Here I stopped afresh - I was about to say 'perusing those old volumes,' then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I went on - 'in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.","No one will thank you for a nap in such a hole! ""What do you mean?"" asked Heathcliff, ""and what do you do? Lie down and watch all night, since you're here; but for goodness' sake! Don't make that horrible noise: nothing would excuse it unless your throat was cut! If that little monster had come in through the window, it probably would have strangled me!"" I replied. ""I will tolerate no more persecution from your Hospitaller ancestors. Wasn't the Reverend Jabez Branderham related to you on your mother's side? And that tramp, Catherine Linton or Earnshaw, or whatever her name was—she must have been a changeling—a wicked little soul! She told me she'd been on earth for twenty years: a just punishment for her fatal transgressions, I'm sure!"" No sooner had he uttered these words than I remembered the connection between Heathcliff and Catherine's name in the book, which had completely vanished from my memory until I awoke. I blushed at my negligence, but without further acknowledging the error, I hastened to add: ""Indeed, sir, I spent the first part of the night—"" Here I paused again—I was about to say, ""In reading these old books,"" which would have revealed my knowledge of their written and printed contents; then I corrected myself and continued: ""In spelling the name scrawled on this windowsill."""
"A monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or - ' 'What CAN you mean by talking in this way to ME!' thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. 'How how DARE you, under my roof? - God! he's mad to speak so!' And he struck his forehead with rage. I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of 'Catherine Linton' before, but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.","A monotonous activity designed to lull me to sleep, like counting or—""Why do you talk to me like that?"" thundered Heathcliff with wild violence. ""How, how dare you, under my roof?"" ""Good God! He's mad to talk like that!"" And he struck his forehead angrily. I hesitated whether to detest this language or insist on my explanation; but he seemed so deeply affected that I was seized with pity and continued to dream. I confessed that I had never heard the name ""Catherine Linton"" before, but the repeated reading of it made an impression that became embodied as my imagination lost control. As I spoke, Heathcliff sank slowly back into the bed; at last he sat up and was almost hidden behind it."
"I guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the night: 'Not three o'clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!' 'Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,' said my host, suppressing a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a tear from his eyes. 'Mr. Lockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my room: you'll only be in the way, coming down- stairs so early: and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.' 'And for me, too,' I replied. 'I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and then I'll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.","I suspected, however, from his irregular and labored breathing that he was struggling with strong emotions. Not wanting him to know that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, glanced at the clock, and chorused about the length of the night: ""Not even three o'clock! I could have sworn it was six o'clock. Time stands still here: we had to go to bed at eight to sleep!"" ""Always up at nine and four in winter,"" said my host, suppressing a groan; and, as I imagined, with a wave of his arm, he wiped a tear from his eye. ""Mr. Lockwood,"" he added, ""you may come into my room; you are only a nuisance coming down so early; and your childish screaming has cost me sleep."" ""And mine too,"" I replied. ""I will walk in the garden until dawn and then leave; and you needn't be afraid that I will disturb you again."""
"I'm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.' 'Delightful company!' muttered Heathcliff. 'Take the candle, and go where you please. I shall join you directly.","I am now completely cured of seeking pleasure in company, whether in the country or in the city. A sensible man should find enough company within himself. ""Pleasant company!"" murmured Heathcliff. ""Take the candle and go wherever you will. I will come to you at once."""
"Keep out of the yard, though, the dogs are unchained; and the house - Juno mounts sentinel there, and - nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But, away with you! I'll come in two minutes!' I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears. 'Come in! come in!' he sobbed. 'Cathy, do come.","But stay away from the garden, the dogs are loose; and from the house... Juno is guarding there, and... no, you can only loiter on the stairs and in the corridors. But come on! I'll be there in two minutes! I obeyed and even left the room; then, not knowing where the narrow corridors led, I stopped and unwillingly witnessed a superstition of my owner, which strangely contradicted his apparent reason. He climbed onto the bed and opened the gate, bursting into tears. ""Come in! Come in!"" he sobbed. ""Cathy, come in."""
"Oh, do - ONCE more! Oh! my heart's darling! hear me THIS time, Catherine, at last!' The spectre showed a spectre's ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the light. There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though WHY was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together, enabled me to rekindle my candle.","Oh, do it... ONCE MORE! Oh, my darling! Listen to me carefully, Catherine! The specter was exhibiting his usual caprices: there was no sign of life; but snow and wind whirled wildly, reaching even my post and extinguishing the light. The wave of grief that accompanied this commotion was so terrible that my pity made me forget his madness. I withdrew, half angry at having listened, and half annoyed at having recounted my ridiculous nightmare; so much anguish did it cause me; but the WHY was incomprehensible to me. Cautiously descending into the underworld, I found myself in the scullery, where a stream of fire, concentrated into a thin beam, enabled me to relight my candle."
"Nothing was stirring except a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a querulous mew. Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.","Nothing stirred, except for a gray-spotted cat that emerged from the ashes and greeted me with a plaintive meow. Two benches arranged in a circle almost surrounded the fireplace; I lay down on one, Grimalkin climbed onto the other. We both nodded before anyone could enter our hiding place, and then it was Joseph who descended a wooden ladder through a trapdoor that disappeared into the roof: access to his attic, I assume."
"He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.","He cast a grim glance at the small flame I had lit between his ribs, pushed the cat from its perch, sat down in the empty space, and began to fill a three-inch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctuary was clearly regarded as an insolence, too shameful to be noticed: silently, he raised the pipe to his lips, folded his arms, and took a drag. I let him enjoy this luxury without the slightest concern; and after emptying his last tankard and heaving a deep sigh, he rose and departed as solemnly as he had come."
"A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a 'good-morning,' but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison SOTTO VOCE, in a series of curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow him.","Then I heard quieter footsteps; I opened my mouth to say ""Good morning,"" but closed it again when the greeting didn't come. Hareton Earnshaw was busy reciting his hymn ""Sotto Voce,"" a series of curses he directed at every object he touched while he searched a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the snowdrifts. He peered over the back of his seat with flared nostrils, thinking no more of exchanging pleasantries with me than with my companion, the cat. His preparations anticipated that I might be allowed out, and I rose from my hard seat and followed him a step."
"He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality. It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.","He noticed this and jabbed his spade against an interior door, signaling to me with an inaudible noise that this was where I should go if I changed my address. The door opened into the house, where the women were already busy; Zillah was blowing flames into the fireplace with a huge bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff was kneeling before the hearth, reading a book near the flames. She held her hand between the heat of the stove and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her work. She only paused to reprimand the servant who was covering her with sparks, or sometimes to push away a dog that was sticking its nose in her face."
"I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an indignant groan. 'And you, you worthless - ' he broke out as I entered, turning to his daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep, but generally represented by a dash - . 'There you are, at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread - you live on my charity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight - do you hear, damnable jade?' 'I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,' answered the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair. 'But I'll not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I please!' Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance, obviously acquainted with its weight.","I was surprised to see Heathcliff too. He was standing by the fire with his back to me after a stormy scene with poor Zillah, who occasionally paused to gather her apron and groan indignantly. ""And you, you good-for-nothing—"" he cried upon my entrance, turning to his daughter-in-law and uttering an oath as innocuous as ""duck"" or ""sheep,"" but usually marked with a hyphen. ""There you go again with your useless antics! Others earn their bread—you live on my charity! Stop your nonsense and find yourself something to do. You will pay me for the torture of having you constantly in my sight—do you hear me, you accursed hussy?"" ""I will stop my nonsense, for you can force me to refuse,"" replied the young woman, closing her book and flinging it onto a chair. ""But I will do nothing, even if you curse your tongue, except what I want!"" Heathcliff raised his hand, and the speaker stepped back to a safer distance, obviously accustomed to his weight."
"Having no desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long.","Not wanting to quarrel like cat and dog, I quickly approached her, as if to enjoy the warmth of the fire and not even notice the interrupted argument. Both showed enough grace to end the hostilities: Heathcliff, tempted, put his fists in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff pursed her lips and sat down on a nearby chair, where she kept her word and played the role of a statue for the rest of my stay. This didn't last long."
"I declined joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice. My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday's walk left pictured in my mind.","I declined their breakfast and, at dawn, took the opportunity to escape into the fresh air, which was now clear and still and cold as icy ice. My host warned me to stop before the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. He had done well, for the entire ridge formed a vast, white, undulating ocean; the waves and depressions suggested no corresponding relief; at least, many depressions were partially filled; and entire chains of hills, remnants of the quarries, had disappeared from the map that my walk yesterday had seared into my memory."
"I had remarked on one side of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road. We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own resources; for the porter's lodge is untenanted as yet.","I had noticed a row of standing stones on one side of the road, spaced every six or seven meters across the entire length of the barren landscape. They had been purpose-built and plastered with lime to serve as landmarks in the dark, even when, as now, a waterfall cut through the deep marshes on either side of the more difficult path. But apart from a few dirty patches here and there, all trace of their existence had vanished. My companion felt the need to remind me repeatedly to turn right or left when I thought I was following the road's switchbacks correctly. We chatted briefly, and he paused at the entrance to Thrushcross Park and said, ""I can't have been mistaken."" We said goodbye with a curt bow, and then I drove on, confident in my own strength; for the gatehouse was still unoccupied."
"The distance from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights. My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming, tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains.","The distance between the gate and the barn is three kilometers; I think I walked four kilometers, after getting lost among the trees and buried up to my neck in snow: a situation that only those who have experienced it can understand. As I entered the house, the clock struck midnight; that meant exactly one hour for every kilometer traveled along the usual route from Wuthering Heights. My human body and its satellites rushed to meet me, crying out loud that they had completely given up: everyone presumed I had died the previous night and wondered how to begin the search for my remains."
"I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment. WHAT vain weathercocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable - I, weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk. 'You have lived here a considerable time,' I commenced; 'did you not say sixteen years?' 'Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her; after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.' 'Indeed.' There ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her own affairs, and those could hardly interest me.","I ordered them to be silent, seeing me return, and, numb to the core, dragged myself upstairs. From there, I put on dry clothes and paced the floor for thirty or forty minutes to keep warm. Then I retired to my study, weak as a kitten: almost too weak to enjoy the warm fire and the steaming coffee the chambermaid had brewed for my refreshment. What vain weathervanes we are! I, who had resolved to abstain from all social intercourse, and who thanked my good fortune to have finally landed in a place where that was practically impossible—I, a weak wretch who had struggled with sadness and loneliness until dusk, was finally forced to take down my flag. Under the pretext of inquiring about the needs of my lodgings, when Mrs. Dean brought in dinner, I asked her to sit down while I ate it. I sincerely hoped she turned out to be a real gossip, and that her chatter would either cheer me up or put me to sleep. ""You've lived here a long time,"" I began. ""Didn't you say sixteen years?"" ""Eighteen, sir. I came to the mistress's wedding to wait on her; after her death, the master hired me as housekeeper."" ""Indeed."" There was silence. She wasn't a gossip, I feared; unless it concerned her own affairs, in which I had little interest."
"However, having studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated - 'Ah, times are greatly changed since then!' 'Yes,' I remarked, 'you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?' 'I have: and troubles too,' she said. 'Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!' I thought to myself. 'A good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more probable, an exotic that the surly INDIGENAE will not recognise for kin.' With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior. 'Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?' I inquired. 'Rich, sir!' she returned. 'He has nobody knows what money, and every year it increases. Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a finer house than this: but he's very near - close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more. It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!' 'He had a son, it seems?' 'Yes, he had one - he is dead.' 'And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?' 'Yes.' 'Where did she come from originally?' 'Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was her maiden name.","But after studying for a while, her fists on her knees, a touch of thoughtfulness across her flushed face, she exclaimed, ""Ah, times have changed since then!"" ""Yes,"" I remarked. ""You've seen many changes, I suppose?"" ""Yes, and trouble too,"" she said. ""Oh, I'll start the conversation with my landlord's family!"" I thought. ""A good subject to begin with! And the beautiful widow—I'd like to know her story: Is she a local or, more likely, a stranger the grumpy local doesn't recognize as his family."" With that in mind, I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff had rented Thrushcross Grange, preferring to live in such squalid conditions and accommodations. ""Isn't he rich enough to manage the estate?"" I asked. ""Rich, sir!"" she replied. ""He has who knows how much money, and it grows every year."" Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a nicer house, but he's very short of money. Even if he'd intended to run away to Thrushcross Grange, he wouldn't have passed up the opportunity to earn a few hundred more the moment he heard of a good tenant. It's strange how people can be so greedy when they're alone in the world! ""He apparently had a son?"" ""Yes, he did; he's dead."" ""And this young woman, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?"" ""Yes."" ""Where did she come from?"" ""Well, sir, she's my late master's daughter; Catherine Linton was her maiden name."""
"I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and then we might have been together again.' 'What! Catherine Linton?' I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute's reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. Then,' I continued, 'my predecessor's name was Linton?' 'It was.' 'And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr. Heathcliff? Are they relations?' 'No; he is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew.' 'The young lady's cousin, then?' 'Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother's, the other on the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister.' 'I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ""Earnshaw"" carved over the front door.","I took care of her, poor thing! I wish Mr. Heathcliff would settle here; we could have seen each other again. ""What? Catherine Linton?"" I exclaimed in surprise. But after a moment's reflection, I convinced myself it wasn't my ghostly Catherine. ""Then,"" I continued, ""my predecessor's name is Linton?"" ""His name was Linton."" ""And who is this Earnshaw, Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr. Heathcliff? Are they related?"" ""No, he is the nephew of the late Mrs. Linton."" ""Then the young lady's nephew?"" ""Yes, and her husband was also her nephew: one on her mother's side, the other on her father's. Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister."" ""I see the house in Wuthering Heights has the inscription 'Earnshaw' on it."""
"Are they an old family?' 'Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us - I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!' 'Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think, not very happy.' 'Oh dear, I don't wonder! And how did you like the master?' 'A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character? 'Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with him the better.' 'He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.","Are they an old family? ""Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you ever been to Wuthering Heights? Excuse me, but I should like to know how she is!"" ""Mrs. Heathcliff? She was very pretty and very handsome; but, I think, not very happy."" ""Oh dear, I'm not surprised! And what did you think of the gentleman?"" ""Rather a rough fellow, Mrs. Dean. Isn't that his temper? Rough as a saw and hard as a stake! The less you have to do with him, the better."" ""He must have had his ups and downs in his life to become such a lout."""
"Do you know anything of his history?' 'It's a cuckoo's, sir - I know all about it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.' 'Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.' 'Oh, certainly, sir! I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then I'll sit as long as you please. But you've caught cold: I saw you shivering, and you must have some gruel to drive it out.' The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.","Do you know his past?' 'He's mad, sir! I know everything about him: except where he was born, who his parents were, and how he earned his money. And Hareton was brought up like a young sparrow! The unfortunate man is the only one in the whole parish who doesn't suspect how he was framed.' 'Well, Mrs. Dean, it would be a charitable act if you told me something about my neighbors: I don't think I could sleep if I went to bed; so, if you will be so kind as to sit down and chat for an hour.' 'Oh, certainly, sir! I'll do some sewing and then sit as long as you like. But you have a cold: I've seen you shivering, and you need porridge to cure it.' The worthy woman hurried away, and I huddled nearer the fire; my head was hot and the rest of my body was cold. I was also nervous and mentally agitated almost to the point of insanity."
"This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find me so companionable. Before I came to live here, she commenced - waiting no farther invitation to her story - I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, and I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to.","It was not that that worried me, but (as still does) the grave consequences of the events of today and yesterday. She returned a little later with a steaming bowl and a work basket; after placing the former on the hearth, she sat down, evidently pleased to find me so sociable. Before I moved here, she began—without waiting for further prompting to tell her story—that I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; for my mother had been looking after Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, Hareton's father, and I had begun to play with the children; besides, I ran errands, helped with the haymaking, and hung around the farmyard, ready to listen to anything anyone wanted to tell me."
"One fine summer morning - it was the beginning of harvest, I remember - Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me - for I sat eating my porridge with them - and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man, I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You may choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!' Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.","One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of the grape harvest, if I remember correctly—Mr. Earnshaw, the old gentleman, came downstairs, ready to travel. After explaining to Joseph what would happen that day, he turned to Hindley, Cathy, and me—for I was sitting with them eating porridge—and said to his son, ""Well, my dear, I'm going to Liverpool today. What shall I take? You can choose what you like. It shall only be a short journey, for I have to walk there and back; sixty miles there and back is a long journey!"" Hindley mentioned a fiddle and then asked Miss Cathy; she was barely six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable and chose a whip. He didn't forget me, for he was kind-hearted, if sometimes a little stern. He promised to bring me a bag full of apples and pears, then kissed his children goodbye and left."
"It seemed a long while to us all - the three days of his absence - and often did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master.","Those three days of absence seemed long to all of us, and little Cathy often asked when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected him around noon on the third evening and postponed dinner for several hours; but there was no sign of his arrival, and finally the children grew tired of constantly running to the gate and watching. Then night fell; she would have sent them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and around eleven o'clock the doorknob opened softly, and the teacher came in."
"He threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly killed - he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms. 'And at the end of it to be flighted to death!' he said, opening his great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. 'See here, wife! I was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e'en take it as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if it came from the devil.' We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its face looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it.","He sank into a chair, laughing and groaning, and ordered them to step aside, for he had almost been killed—he did not want to take another walk like this through the Three Kingdoms. “And in the end, I shall be chased to my death!” he said, opening his coat, which he held tightly in his arms. “You see, woman! I have never been beaten so badly in my life, but you must still consider it a gift from God; even if it is almost as grim as if it came from the devil.” We crowded around Miss Cathy, and over Miss Cathy’s head I watched a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough to walk and talk: his face did look older than Catherine’s; but as soon as he was on his feet, he just looked around, talking incessantly about himself and talking nonsense that no one understood. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was about to throw him out. She rushed over and asked how he had managed to bring this gypsy girl into the house when they had children of their own to feed and raise. What did he intend to do with her, and had he gone mad? The gentleman tried to explain the situation, but was completely exhausted, and all I could gather from his grumbling was that he had seen her starving, homeless, and almost mute on the streets of Liverpool, picked her up, and asked for her owner. No one knew who she belonged to, he said; and since he had little money or time, he thought it best to take her home immediately rather than incur unnecessary expense, as he was determined not to leave her in the same condition in which he found her."
"Well, the conclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children. Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners.","Well, the result was that my mistress murmured softly; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash him, give him clean clothes, and let him sleep with the children. Hindley and Cathy just watched and listened until quiet returned; then they both began to rummage in their father's pockets for the presents he had promised them. The first was a fourteen-year-old boy, but when he produced a fiddle that was crushed in his coat, he began to sob loudly; and when Cathy heard that the master had lost his whip while serving the stranger, she showed her humor by smiling and spitting on the little animal, which earned her a good spanking from her father to teach her manners.""They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might he gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.","They categorically refused to allow him into their bed or even into their room. At my wit's end, I left him on the landing, hoping he would be gone the next day. By chance, or lured by the sound of his voice, he crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door and found him leaving his room. They inquired about his arrival; I was forced to confess and was expelled from the house as a reward for my cowardice and inhumanity."
"This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family. On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.","This was Heathcliff's first acquaintance with the family. When I returned a few days later (for I did not consider my banishment final), I learned that they had called him ""Heathcliff"": this was the name of a son who had died young, and it had served him ever since both as a Christian and as a family name. He and Miss Cathy had become very much at odds; but Hindley hated him; and so did I. We teased him and treated him with disgrace; for I had not enough sense to feel the wrong I was doing, and the mistress never spoke to him when she saw him wronged."
"He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill- treatment: he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.","He seemed like a sullen and patient child, perhaps hardened by his abuse: he bore Hindley's blows without flinching or shedding a tear, and my pinches only made him breathe and open his eyes, as if he had accidentally hurt himself without anyone blaming him. This endurance drove old Earnshaw to despair when he discovered that his son was stalking the poor fatherless boy, as he called him. He felt a strange attachment to Heathcliff, believed everything he said (though he said very little, and mostly the truth), and valued him far more than Cathy, who was too mischievous and stubborn to be his favorite."
"So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.","Thus, from the beginning, he maintained resentment in the house; and after Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which occurred less than two years later, the young master regarded his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parents' affections and privileges; and he became bitter from brooding over this injustice. I sympathized for a time; but when the children were swept away by the measles, and I had to care for them as well as my wife, I changed my mind. Heathcliff was gravely ill; and in his worst times, I was constantly at his side. I suppose he felt I was doing much for him, and was not aware that I was under a duty to do so."
"However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.","But I must say, he was the quietest child any nanny has ever had. The difference between him and the others forced me to be less judgmental. Cathy and her little brother got on my nerves terribly: He was as whiny as a lamb; but his harshness, not his gentleness, caused him little trouble."
"He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.","He recovered, and the doctor, realizing I owed him much, congratulated me on my recovery. I was proud of his praise and became more indulgent toward the man who deserved it. Thus, Hindley lost his last ally. But I failed to charm Heathcliff, and I often wondered what my master admired so much in that gloomy fellow; who, as far as I remember, never showed him the slightest gratitude. He was not rude to his benefactor; he was simply unfeeling; though he was conscious of his hold on his heart and knew that a single word would suffice to subjugate the entire household to his wishes."
"They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might he gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.", "They categorically refused to allow him into their bed or even into their room. With no other choice, I left him on the landing, hoping he would be gone the next day. By luck or drawn by the sound of his voice, he crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door and sleeped in his chamber. They asked about why he was here; I was forced to confess and was expelled from the house as a reward for my cowardice and inhumanity."
"As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley 'You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.' Hindley put out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. 'You'd better do it at once,' he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): 'you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with interest.' 'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. 'Throw it,' he replied, standing still, 'and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly.' Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused it. 'Take my colt, Gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw. 'And I pray that he may break your neck: take him, and he damned, you beggarly interloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what you are, imp of Satan. - And take that, I hope he'll kick out your brains!' Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house.","I remember, for example, how Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of foals at the church fair and gave one to each boy. Heathcliff took the prettiest, but it soon developed a limp. When he found out, he said to Hindley, ""You must trade your horses with me. I don't like mine. And if you don't, I'll tell your father about the three blows you gave me this week and show him my arm, which is black all the way to the shoulder."" Hindley stuck out his tongue and slapped him on the ears. ""Better do it right now,"" he insisted, running out to the veranda (they were in the stable). ""You must do it. And when I tell you about the blows, you'll get them back with interest."" ""Go away, dog!"" ""Hindley cried, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. ""Throw it down,"" he replied, stopping, ""and I'll tell you how you boasted you'd send me away as soon as it was dead, and I'll see if it doesn't send you away right away."" Hindley threw it and hit him on the chest. The animal fell, but got up immediately, panting and pale; and if I hadn't stopped him, he would have gone straight to the master and taken revenge by redeeming his situation and revealing who was the cause. ""Then take my colt, Gypsy!"" said young Earnshaw. ""And I pray he'll break your neck. Take it, and he'll curse you, you poor intruder! And he'll blame my father for everything he has."" So show him who you are, you devil."" And take this, I hope it blows your brains out!"" Heathcliff had gone to untie the animal and lead it into its stable. After he had finished his speech, he ran after Hindley, beating him underfoot. Without checking whether his hopes had been realized, he ran off as fast as he could. I was amazed to see with what composure the child regained his senses and continued with his plan; he changed saddles and then sat down on a bale of hay to overcome the remorse caused by the violent blow he had received before entering the house."
"I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear. IN the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.","I easily convinced him to attribute his bruises to the horse: He didn't care what story was told, because he already had what he wanted. He complained so rarely about such problems that I didn't think he was vindictive: I had, as you will hear, been completely cheated. Over time, Mr. Earnshaw's condition worsened."
"He had been active and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn.","He had been active and healthy, but suddenly his strength left him; and when he locked himself near the fireplace, he became terribly irritable. Nothing could disturb him; the slightest insult to his authority drove him almost to a rage. This was especially noticeable when someone tried to influence or dominate his favorite: he was terribly jealous of anyone who spoke unkindly to him; he seemed to have understood that everyone hated him and wanted to harm him because he loved Heathcliff."
"It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that he could not do it. At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said - 'Hindley was nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.' I hoped heartily we should have peace now.","This was a disadvantage for the boy; for the kindest among us did not want to anger the teacher, so we indulged his partiality; and this indulgence only fed the child's pride and capriciousness. Yet in a way it was necessary; two or three times, while his father was there, Hindley's contempt provoked the old man to anger: he seized his staff to strike him, and trembled with rage because he could not. At last our minister (we had a minister then who offered the practical solution by teaching little Linton and Earnshaw and cultivating his own piece of land) advised the young man to go to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though in a melancholy voice, for he said, ""Hindley was nothing and would never succeed wandering about."" I sincerely hoped we would now have peace."
"It hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two people - Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up yonder.","It pained me that the master would be ashamed of his good deed. I suspected that the discontent over age and illness was due to family discord; and indeed, it was as he had wished: you know, sir, it was due to his declining health. Nevertheless, we would have gotten along quite well if it hadn't been for two people: Miss Cathy and Joseph, the servant; you must have seen him up there."
"He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly.","He was and is probably the most boring and self-righteous Pharisee who ever leafed through the Bible, read out promises, and cursed his neighbors. His gift for preaching and his pious speeches made a deep impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the weaker his master became, the greater his influence grew. He was incessantly concerned for the welfare of his soul and the strict guidance of his children."
"He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter. Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief. Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going - singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.","He encouraged them to regard Hindley as a depraved man; and night after night he regularly whispered a long series of stories to Heathcliff and Catherine, always trying to flatter Earnshaw's weakness by blaming her. She certainly had a knack for things I have never seen in any child; and she tried our patience fifty times a day and more: from the hour she went downstairs to the hour she went to bed, we never had the slightest assurance that she was not up to mischief. She was always good-humored, her tongue always at work: she sang, laughed, and teased anyone who compelled her."
"A wild, wicked slip she was - but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us on his account.","She was a wild and wicked bitch, but she had the most beautiful eyes, the sweetest smile, and the lightest foot in the whole parish. Finally, I believe she meant no harm; for when she did make you cry, she rarely kept you company and forced you to be silent so you could comfort her. She loved Heathcliff far too much. The worst punishment we could imagine for her was to separate her from him. Yet she was held more responsible for this than any of us."
"Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly - 'Are they gone yet?' Then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping - and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn't know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds.","Every object she saw as soon as she crossed the threshold seemed to delight her, as did everything around her, except for the funeral preparations and the presence of the mourners. I thought she was mad when I observed her behavior during this time: she ran to her room and forced me to accompany her, even though I should have dressed the children; and there she sat trembling with clasped hands, asking again and again, ""Are they gone yet?"" Then, in hysterical excitement, she began to describe how the sight of the blackness affected her; she shuddered, trembled, and finally burst into tears. When I asked her what was wrong, she replied, ""She didn't know, but she was so afraid of dying!"" I imagined that she was no more likely to die than I was. She was rather thin, but young, with a fresh complexion, and her eyes shone like diamonds."
"I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to us first. Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence.","I noticed that she breathed very rapidly when climbing stairs, trembled at the slightest noise, and sometimes coughed unpleasantly. But I didn't know the significance of these symptoms and felt no need to show sympathy. We generally don't like strangers here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they like us first. Young Earnshaw has changed markedly since he left three years ago."
"He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention. She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.","He had grown thin, lost his color, and spoke and dressed quite differently. On the day of his return, he announced to Joseph and me that from now on we would stay in the scullery and leave the house to him. He would have liked to paper and repaper a small guest room and convert it into a living room; but his wife was so charmed by the white floor, the huge blazing fireplace, the pewter dishes, the puppet theater, the doghouse, and the large gymnasium where they usually sat that he considered them superfluous and therefore abandoned the project. She, too, was delighted to count a sister among her new acquaintances; she chatted with Catherine, kissed her, ran with her, and at first gave her many presents."
"Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy. He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm.","Her affection soon cooled, however, and when she became surly, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her revealing her dislike for Heathcliff were enough to reawaken his old hatred for the boy. He banished him from her company and left him in the care of the servants, deprived him of the vicar's instructions, and insisted on his outdoor work, forcing him to work as hard as any other boy on the farm."
"Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.","At first, Heathcliff bore his humiliation quite well. Cathy taught him what she had learned and worked or played with him in the fields. Both promised to grow up as rude as savages; the young gentleman was completely negligent in their behavior and actions, so they kept their distance from him. He never saw him again after Sunday service; only Joseph and the minister reprimanded him for his negligence during their absence, which reminded him that he must whip Heathcliff and fast Catherine."
"But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.","Yet one of their greatest pleasures was escaping to the moor in the morning and staying there all day. The punishment for this was a joke. The vicar had the right to write as many chapters as he wanted for Catherine to memorize, and Joseph had the right to beat Heathcliff until his arm ached. They forgot everything as soon as they were together again, or at least as soon as they had hatched a Machiavellian plan of revenge. I often wept as I watched them grow more ruthless day by day, and dared not say a word for fear of losing what little influence I still had over these hostile creatures. One Sunday evening, it happened that they were banished from the drawing-room for fighting or some other minor offense. And when I went to call her to dinner, she was nowhere to be found."
"We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household went to bed; and I, too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate.","We searched the house from top to bottom, the yard, and the stables; they were nowhere to be seen. Finally, Hindley, furious, ordered us to lock the gate and swore that no one would let them in that night. The whole family went to bed; I too, impatient to lie down, opened my gate and, despite the rain, stuck my head out to listen. Determined to let them in, despite the prohibition, if they came back. After a while, I heard footsteps coming up the street, and the light of a lantern shone through the gate."
"I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone. 'Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly. 'No accident, I hope?' 'At Thrushcross Grange,' he answered; 'and I would have been there too, but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.' 'Well, you will catch it!' I said: 'you'll never be content till you're sent about your business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?' 'Let me get off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,' he replied.","I threw a handkerchief over my head and ran away to avoid being awakened by Mr. Earnshaw's knocking. Heathcliff was there, all alone; I was surprised to see him alone. ""Where is Miss Catherine?"" I called out hastily. ""Not by chance, I hope?"" ""To Thrushcross Grange,"" he answered; ""and I would have gone there too, but they weren't polite enough to ask me to stay."" ""Well, have it!"" I said. ""You'll never be satisfied until you're back at work. What on earth brought you to Thrushcross Grange?"" ""Let me take off my wet clothes and I'll tell you everything, Nelly,"" he answered."
"I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued - 'Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?' 'Probably not,' I responded. 'They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.' 'Don't cant, Nelly,' he said: 'nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping - Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.","I told him not to wake the professor. While he undressed and I waited to blow out the candle, he continued, ""Cathy and I sneaked out of the laundry room to look around. When we saw the lights in the barn, we thought we'd see if the Lintons spend their Sunday evenings shivering in a corner while their parents eat, drink, sing, laugh, and burn their eyes out by the fire. Do you think they do that? Or read sermons, take lessons from their servant, and learn a bunch of Bible verses when they don't answer correctly?"" ""Probably not,"" I replied. ""They're really good children and don't deserve the treatment you're getting for your bad behavior."" ""That can't be right, Nelly,"" he said, ""that's nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park without stopping. Catherine lost the race completely because she was barefoot. Tomorrow you'll have to search the swamp for her shoes."""
"We crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw - ah! it was beautiful - a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft tapers.","We squeezed through a ragged hedge, groped our way up the path, and settled down in a small flowerbed under the living room window. That's where the light came from; the shutters weren't drawn, the curtains half-drawn. Standing in the cellar, clinging to the windowsill, we could both see in, and we saw—ah! It was magnificent! A magnificent place, with crimson carpets, crimson chairs and tables, and a brilliant white ceiling trimmed in gold, in the center of which a shower of glass droplets hung from silver chains, sparkling in the light of small, dim candles."
"Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sisters had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been happy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good children were doing? Isabella - I believe she is eleven, a year younger than Cathy - lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.","The old Lintons weren't there; Edgar and his sisters were alone. Shouldn't they have been happy? It was like heaven! And guess what your dear children were doing now? Isabella—I think she's eleven, a year younger than Cathy—was screaming through the room as if witches were piercing her with red-hot needles. Edgar was weeping softly by the fire, and in the middle of the table sat a small dog, shaking its paw and whining; and from their mutual reproaches, we gathered that they had almost been separated."
"The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange - not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the housefront with Hindley's blood!' 'Hush, hush!' I interrupted. 'Still you have not told me, Heathcliff, how Catherine is left behind?' 'I told you we laughed,' he answered. 'The Lintons heard us, and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and then a cry, ""Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa, oh!"" They really did howl out something in that way.","Those idiots! It was their amusement! They argued over who should get a tuft of warm hair, and both began to cry because, after some struggle, they refused to accept it. We laughed at those pampered creatures; we despised them! When would you find me wanting what Catherine wanted? Or would you find us alone, taking our pleasure in screaming, sobbing, and rolling on the floor, separated by the whole room? I wouldn't exchange my situation here for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange for a thousand lifetimes, even if I had the privilege of throwing Joseph off the highest gable and painting him with Hindley's blood! ""Shh, shh!"" I interrupted. ""Heathcliff, haven't you told me how Catherine was left behind?"" ""I told you we laugh,"" he answered. The Lintons heard us, and shot arrows at the door as if from one mouth; there was silence, then a cry: ""Oh, mother, mother! Oh, father! Oh, mother, come here. Oh, father, oh!"" They cried something like that."
"We made frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell down. ""Run, Heathcliff, run!"" she whispered. ""They have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!"" The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out - no! she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow.","We made terrifying noises to scare her even more, then we tumbled over the edge because someone was closing the bars, and decided to run away. I was holding Cathy's hand, encouraging her, when she suddenly collapsed. ""Run, Heathcliff, run!"" she whispered. ""They've let the bulldog loose, and he's holding me!"" The devil had grabbed her ankle, Nelly: I heard his horrible growl. She didn't scream—no! She would have reluctantly, if she'd been spat upon by the horns of a mad cow."
"I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting - ""Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!"" He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver.","But I managed it: I shouted so many curses that I could destroy every demon in Christendom; I grabbed a stone, shoved it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to ram it down his throat. Finally, a servant came running with a lantern, shouting, ""Stop, Skulker, stop!"" He changed his mind, however, when he saw Skulker's play. The dog was strangled; his huge purple tongue hung out a good six inches, and bloody saliva dripped from his drooping lips."
"The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. ""What prey, Robert?"" hallooed Linton from the entrance. ""Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,"" he replied; ""and there's a lad here,"" he added, making a clutch at me, ""who looks an out-and- outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul- mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this.","The man picked Cathy up; she felt sick: not with fear, I'm sure, but with pain. He carried her inside; I followed him, muttering curses and vengeful. ""What loot, Robert?"" Linton called from the doorway. ""Skulker has a little girl, sir,"" he answered; ""and here's a boy,"" he added, clinging to me, ""who looks just like her! He looks just like the robbers who dragged her out the window to open the doors for the gang after everyone was asleep, so they could kill us at will. Shut up, you rude thief! You'll end up on the hangman for this."""
"Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun."" ""No, no, Robert,"" said the old fool. ""The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten the chain.","Mr. Linton, sir, don't lower your weapon. ""No, no, Robert,"" said the old fool. ""Those scoundrels knew I had to pay my rent yesterday. They thought they could get their hands on me. Come in, I'll give them a warm welcome. Here, John, fasten the chain."""
"Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be afraid, it is but a boy - yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as well as features?"" He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping - ""Frightful thing! Put him in the cellar, papa.","Give Skulker some water, Jenny. Attacking a judge in his fortress, and on the Sabbath too! Where will their impudence end? Oh, my dear Mary, look! Don't be afraid, he's only a child—and yet the villain looks so pretentious; wouldn't it be a service to the country to hang him immediately, before he reveals his true colors and deeds? He dragged me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton put on her spectacles and threw up her hands in horror. The cowardly children also came forward, while Isabel whispered, ""Dreadful deed! Take him to the cellar, Papa."""
"He's exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't he, Edgar?"" 'While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognise her.","He looks just like the son of the fortune-teller who stole my pheasant. Is that right, Edgar? While they were examining me, Cathy came to her senses; she heard the last speech and laughed. Edgar Linton looked curious and found enough humor to recognize her."
"They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet them elsewhere. ""That's Miss Earnshaw?"" he whispered to his mother, ""and look how Skulker has bitten her - how her foot bleeds!"" '""Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!"" cried the dame; ""Miss Earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning - surely it is - and she may be lamed for life!"" '""What culpable carelessness in her brother!"" exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from me to Catherine. ""I've understood from Shielders""' (that was the curate, sir) '""that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism. But who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to Liverpool - a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway."" '""A wicked boy, at all events,"" remarked the old lady, ""and quite unfit for a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I'm shocked that my children should have heard it."" 'I recommenced cursing - don't be angry, Nelly - and so Robert was ordered to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly, secured the door again.","We're seen in church, you know, whereas we rarely see them anywhere else. ""Is that Miss Earnshaw?"" he whispered to his mother, ""and look how Skulker bit her! How her foot is bleeding!"" ""Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!"" cried the lady. ""Miss Earnshaw is traveling across the country with a gypsy! And yet, my dear, the child is grieving—really—and may be left crippled forever!"" ""What culpable neglect of her brother!"" cried Mr. Linton, turning from me to Catherine. ""I've heard from Shielders"" (that was the minister, sir), ""that he's raising her in complete paganism. But who is he? Where did she get that companion? Ouch!"" I assure you, it's that strange acquisition my late neighbor made on his voyage to Liverpool: a little lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway."" ""What a naughty fellow,"" remarked the old lady, ""and quite unfit for a proper home! Did you notice his language, Linton? I'm shocked my children heard it."" I began to swear again—don't be angry, Nelly—and Robert was ordered to take me away. I refused to leave without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pressed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw must be informed of my behavior, and closed the door after ordering me to leave immediately."
"The curtains were still looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine.","In one corner, the curtains were still drawn, and I resumed my watchful eye; for if Catherine wanted to come back, I would smash the large panes to a thousand pieces if they didn't release her. She sat quietly on the sofa. Mrs. Linton took off the milkmaid's gray coat, which we had borrowed for our outing, shook her head, and, presumably, scolded her: She was a young woman, and they treated her differently than me."
"Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons - a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them - to everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?' 'There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered, covering him up and extinguishing the light. 'You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if he won't.' My words came truer than I desired.","Then the maid brought a basin of hot water and washed her feet; Mr. Linton made a glass of Negus, and Isabella emptied a plate of biscuits into her lap, while Edgar stood open-mouthed at a distance. Then they dried and combed her beautiful hair, gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and rolled her to the fire; and I left her there, as cheerful as possible, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, pinching whose nose she ate as he ate; and a spark of wit lit in the Lintons' empty blue eyes—a dim reflection of her own charming face. I saw that they were full of stupid admiration; she is so much superior to them—to anyone in the world, isn't she, Nelly? 'More will happen than you think,' I answered, tucking him in and putting out the light. You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley must do all he can to see that he doesn't. My words have come true more than I had hoped."
"The luckless adventure made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found it impossible.","This unfortunate adventure drove Earnshaw to despair. To settle the matter, Mr. Linton came to us in person the next day, and the young gentleman preached such a sermon about the journey he was making with his family that he began to look around him seriously. Heathcliff was not flogged, but was told that the first word he uttered to Miss Catherine would bring about his dismissal. Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to detain her sister-in-law on her return; she used cunning, not force: force would have been impossible for her."
"CATHY stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in.","Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks, until Christmas. Her ankle had now fully healed, and her manners had improved considerably. The lady of the house visited her often during this time and began her plan of reform, attempting to boost her self-esteem with fine clothes and flattery, which she gladly accepted. Thus, instead of a small, hatless savage bounding around the house trying to trick us, there appeared a ""very respectable person,"" a beautiful black pony with brown curls falling from its beaver plumage, and a long cloth dress that she had to hold with both hands to put on."
"Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?' 'Isabella has not her natural advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things - Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls - let me untie your hat.' I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.","Hindley lifted her from her horse and exclaimed enthusiastically: ""What a beauty, Cathy! I hardly recognized you: you already look like a lady. Isabella Linton is nothing like her, is she, Frances?"" ""Isabella has not her natural qualities,"" replied his wife, ""but she must be careful not to get out of hand here again. Ellen, help Miss Catherine put away her things. Wait a moment, dear, you are loosening your ringlets. Let me open your hat."" I took off her coat, and there glittered a magnificent checked silk dress, white breeches, and polished shoes; and although her eyes sparkled gaily when the dogs came to greet her, she hardly dared to touch them for fear they might hide her fine clothes."
"She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends. Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.","She kissed me gently: I had no more flour for the Christmas cake, and embracing me would have been pointless. Then she turned to Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched their meeting intently, thinking it would give them an idea of why they wanted to separate the two friends. Heathcliff was difficult to find at first."
"If he were careless, and uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded.","If he was already unkempt and neglected before Catherine's absence, he had become ten times more so since. No one but me was kind enough to call him a dirty little boy and ask him to wash once a week; and children his age rarely enjoy soap and water. Not to mention his clothes, which had been exposed to mud and dust for three months, and his thick, unkempt hair. His face and hands, too, were terribly dull."
"He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected. 'Is Heathcliff not here?' she demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors. 'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself. 'You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like the other servants.' Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how - how funny and grim! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?' She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable. 'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a way, that is permitted.' 'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!' And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again. 'I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only that you looked odd.","He could well have hidden behind the sofa when he saw such a bright and graceful young woman enter, instead of her shaggy counterpart, as he had expected. ""Isn't Heathcliff in?"" she asked, pulling off her gloves and revealing her fingers, which were strangely white from inactivity and from being indoors. ""Heathcliff, you may come up,"" cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfort and delighting in what a fearsome young villain he must be imagining. ""You may come in and greet Miss Catherine as the other servants do."" Cathy, seeing her hidden friend, rushed forward to embrace her; she gave her seven or eight kisses on the cheek in a second, then stopped, drew back, burst into laughter, and exclaimed, ""How dark and sullen you look! And how—how funny and sinister!"" ""But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton."" ""Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?"" She was right in her request, for shame and pride darkened his face and left him motionless. ""Help me, Heathcliff,"" said Mr. Earnshaw condescendingly; ""if it's allowed."" ""Not I,"" replied the boy, finally regaining his speech; ""I can't bear to be laughed at. I can't bear it!"" He made to break away from the circle, but Miss Cathy held him back. ""I didn't mean to laugh at you,"" she said; ""I couldn't help it: Heathcliff, at least help me! Why are you so sullen? You only look funny."""
"If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will be all right: but you are so dirty!' She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his. 'You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and snatching away his hand. 'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty.' With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper. After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.","If you wash your face and comb your hair, everything will be all right. But you are so dirty! She looked anxiously at the black fingers she held in hers and at her dress. She feared it had been dulled by the contact of his. ""You shouldn't have touched me!"" he replied, following her gaze and withdrawing his hand. ""I will be as dirty as I please. And I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty."" With that, he hurried from the room, to the laughter of master and mistress, and to the great dismay of Catherine, who could not understand how his remarks could provoke such an outburst of displeasure. After playing maid to the newcomer, putting my cakes in the oven, and lighting the house and kitchen with large fires as befits Christmas Eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself with Christmas carols all by myself. Although Joseph protested that he did not consider the cheerful melodies I had chosen as songs, he had retired to his room for silent prayer, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw had attracted Missy's attention with all sorts of cheerful trinkets they had bought for her to give to the Linton children as a token of appreciation for their kindness."
"They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.' Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular care - the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to crying.","They had invited her to spend the next day at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation was accepted on one condition: Mrs. Linton requested that her pets be carefully kept away from that ""bad boy who swears."" Under these circumstances, I was left alone. I breathed in the rich aroma of warm spices; I admired the gleaming kitchen utensils, the polished clock decorated with holly, the silver tankards on a tray, ready to be filled with mulled wine for dinner; and, above all, the immaculate cleanliness to which I had taken special care: the scrubbed and swept floor. I applauded each item wholeheartedly, and then I remembered old Earnshaw coming in when everything was put away, calling me a hypocrite, and pressing a shilling into my hand like a Christmas present; and then I began to think of his affection for Heathcliff and his fear of being neglected after his death. This, of course, made me think about the poor boy's current situation, and my thoughts changed from singing to crying."
"It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom. 'Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.' He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me. 'Come - are you coming?' I continued. 'There's a little cake for each of you, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.' I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.","I soon realized, however, that it would be wiser to atone for some of his mistakes rather than dwell on them. So I got up and went into the yard to look for him. He was not far away; I found him in the stable, where, as usual, he was smoothing the new pony's shiny coat and feeding the other animals. ""Hurry up, Heathcliff!"" I said. ""The kitchen is so cozy; and Joseph is upstairs. Hurry, I want to dress you before Miss Cathy comes out. Then you can sit together, before the fire, and talk for a long time until bedtime."" He continued his work without turning to face me. ""Come—come?"" I asked. ""There's a small cake for each of you, almost enough; and it will take you half an hour to dress."" I waited five minutes but received no reply. Catherine was eating with her brother and sister-in-law. Joseph and I had an unpleasant meal together, with accusations from one and spiteful remarks from the other."
"His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back.","His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to work until nine o'clock, then went silently and gloomily to his room. Cathy stayed up late, for she had a thousand and one things to prepare for the reception of her new friends. She once went into the kitchen to speak with her old friend; but he was gone, and she stayed only to ask him what was the matter, and then went back again."
"In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly - 'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.' 'High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you HAVE grieved Catherine: she's sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her, because she is more thought of than you.' The notion of ENVYING Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough. 'Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious. 'She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.' 'Well, I cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry than she.' 'Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach,' said I. 'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.","The next morning he got up early, and since it was a holiday, he took his bad mood with him to the moor and didn't reappear until the family had left for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have improved his spirits. He stayed with me for a while, and then, after summoning all his courage, he suddenly called out, ""Nelly, do me a favor; I'll be good."" ""It's high time, Heathcliff,"" I said. ""You've given Catherine grief; she's sorry she came home, I suppose! It's as if you envy her, for she's more highly esteemed than you."" The idea of capturing Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the idea of making her suffer he understood perfectly. ""Did she say she was sad?"" he asked, looking very serious. ""She wept when I told her you came out again this morning."" ""Well, I cried last night,"" he replied, ""and I had more reason to cry than she did."" ""Yes, you were right to go to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach,"" I said. ""Proud people bring grief on themselves."""
"But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say - you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does.","But if you are ashamed of your vulnerability, you must ask her forgiveness, mind you, when she comes in. You must go to her, kiss her, and tell her—you know better than anyone what to say; but do it sincerely, and not as if you thought her beautiful dress made her a stranger. And now, although I must cook dinner, I will take the time to make sure Edgar Linton looks splendid by your side: and he does."
"You are younger, and yet, I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?' Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed. 'But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!' 'And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to the glass, and I'll let you see what you should wish.","You are younger, and yet, I tell you, you are taller, and have twice as broad shoulders; you could knock him down in a heartbeat; don't you think you could?"" Heathcliff's face brightened for a moment; then it darkened again, and he sighed. ""But, Nelly, even if I knocked him down twenty times, he would be no less handsome, and I would be more handsome. I wish I had fair hair and a fair complexion, dressed well and behaved well, and been lucky enough to be as rich as he is!"" ""And all around,"" cried Mamma,"" I added, ""and trembled like a country boy who shakes his fist and sits at home all day waiting for a shower. Oh, Heathcliff, you are a poor fellow! Come before the glass, and I'll show you everything you could wish for."""
"Do you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil's spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don't get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.' 'In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even forehead,' he replied. 'I do - and that won't help me to them.' 'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly. And now that we've done washing, and combing, and sulking - tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome? I'll tell you, I do.","Do you see the two wrinkles between your eyes?

Do not make the face of a spiteful fool, who seems to know that the blows he receives are his own doing, and yet hates the whole world, just like the kicker, for what he suffers. ""In other words, I must wish for the large blue eyes and regular brow of Edgar Linton,"" he replied. ""I wish it, and it will avail me nothing."" ""A good heart would help you have a pretty face, my boy,"" I continued, ""if you were a real Negro; and a bad person turns the most beautiful thing into something worse than ugly.

"You're fit for a prince in disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!' So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.","You are worthy of a prince in disguise. Who knows, perhaps your father was Emperor of China and your mother Queen of India, and both could have bought Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a week's wages? And you were kidnapped by cruel sailors and brought to England. If I were you, I would have high hopes about my parentage; and the memory of who I am would give me the courage and dignity to endure the oppression of a smallholder! Thus I prattled on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his sullen expression and assumed a rather pleasant air, when our conversation was suddenly interrupted by a rumble from the street and the courtyard."
"He ran to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces. I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.","He ran to the window and I to the door. Just in time, I saw the two Lintons, dressed in coats and furs, get out of the family carriage and the Earnshaws dismount; they often rode their bicycles to church in winter. Catherine took each of the children by the hand, led them inside, and set them before the fire, which quickly colored their pale faces. I urged my companion to come quickly and be friendly, and he readily obeyed; but unfortunately, as Hindley opened the kitchen door on one side, he opened it on the other as well."
"They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the room send him into the garret till dinner is over. He'll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them a minute.' 'Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.' 'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till dark,' cried Hindley. 'Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks - see if I won't pull them a bit longer!' 'They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the doorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache. It's like a colt's mane over his eyes!' He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.","They met, and the master, annoyed at his handsome and cheerful appearance, or perhaps anxious to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, elbowed him away and angrily ordered Joseph: ""Keep the fellow out of the room and send him up to the attic until after dinner. He'll put his fingers in the cakes and steal the fruit if he's alone with them for a moment."" ""No, sir,"" I could not help replying, ""he won't touch anything, absolutely not: and I think he deserves his share of dainties as much as we do."" ""He'll have his share from me if I catch him downstairs before dark,"" cried Hindley. ""Get out of here, you tramp! What? Are you trying to catch that slimy creature? Wait until I get those elegant curls—see if I don't pull a little harder!"" ""They're long enough already,"" remarked Mr. Linton, looking out of the door; ""I wonder if they won't give him a headache."" ""They look like a foal's mane over his eyes!"" He ventured this remark without any intention of offense; but Heathcliff's aggressive nature did not expect any appearance of impertinence from one whom, even at this time, he seemed to hate as a rival."
"He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his gripe) and dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless. I got the dishcloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling.","He grabbed a tureen of hot applesauce (the first thing that upset him) and hurled it with all his might into the speaker's face and throat. He immediately began to wail, whereupon Isabella and Catherine rushed over. Mr. Earnshaw immediately seized the offender and led him to his room, where he undoubtedly administered some brutal remedy to calm his anger, for he was red and out of breath. I grabbed the rag and rubbed Edgar's nose and mouth with some force to reassure him that he had every right to intervene."
"His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all. 'You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton. 'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can't eat my dinner. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?' 'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket- handkerchief. 'I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.' 'Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously; 'you're not killed. Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush, Isabella! Has anybody hurt you?' 'There, there, children - to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling in. 'That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.","Her sister began to cry to get home, and Cathy stood there, astonished and blushing before everyone. ""You shouldn't have spoken to him!"" she protested to Master Linton. ""He was in a bad mood, and now you've spoiled your visit; and he's being whipped: I hate being whipped! I can't finish my supper. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?"" ""I didn't speak to him,"" sobbed the young man, slipping from me and finishing the rest of his toilette with his cambric handkerchief. ""I promised Mother I wouldn't say a word to him, and I didn't."" ""Come on, don't cry,"" replied Catherine contemptuously; ""you haven't been killed. Don't make another fuss; my brother is coming: Be quiet! Quiet, Isabella! Has anyone hurt you?"" ""Come, come, children, to your places!"" cried Hindley, as he entered. “The strong boy warmed me up wonderfully.”"
"Next time, Master Edgar, take the law into your own fists - it will give you an appetite!' The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them merry with lively talk.","Next time, take matters into your own hands, Master Edgar. You'll be hungry! The small group recovered at the sight of the fragrant feast. They were hungry after their ride and could easily console themselves because they were all right. Mr. Earnshaw opened plenty of plates, and the lady entertained them with lively conversation."
"I waited behind her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her. 'An unfeeling child,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old playmate's troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.' She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.","I waited behind her chair and watched with a heavy heart as Catherine, dry-eyed and indifferent, began clipping a goose's wing right in front of her. ""What an insensitive child!"" I thought; ""How she ignores her former playmate's concerns! I never knew she could be so selfish."" She raised a bite to her lips and then put it down again. Her cheeks flushed, and tears streamed down. She dropped her fork to the floor and hastily slipped under the rug to hide her feelings."
"I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals. In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the deficiency.","It didn't take long for me to convince her that she was unconscious. I had noticed that she had spent the entire day in Purgatory, longing for an opportunity to fly alone or visit Heathcliff, who had been imprisoned by the Lord. I realized this when I tried to arrange a private dinner for him. That evening, we danced. Cathy pleaded for his release, as Isabella Linton had no partner. Her pleas were in vain, and I was tasked with making up for the shortfall."
"We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees.","The excitement of the exercise dispelled our despondency, and our joy was further enhanced by the arrival of Gimmerton's Band, a fifteen-piece ensemble including trumpets, trombones, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and bass viols, as well as singers. They visit all the wealthy homes every Christmas and receive gifts, and it was a joy to listen to them. After the usual Christmas carols, we sang our songs and were merry."
"Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty. Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people.","Mrs. Earnshaw loved music, so they gave us plenty. Catherine liked it too, but she said it was better at the top of the stairs, so she went up in the dark. I followed her. They closed the ground floor door without noticing we were gone; there were so many people there."
"She made no stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn her.","She didn't stay at the top of the stairs, but went up to the attic, where Heathcliff was locked, and called him. He stubbornly refused to answer for a while; she persisted and finally persuaded him to pray with her through the boards. I left the poor creatures chatting quietly until I guessed the singing was about to stop and the singers would have something to eat and drink; then I climbed the ladder to warn them."
"Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound of our 'devil's psalmody,' as it pleased him to call it.","But instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice inside. The little monkey had crawled through the skylight of one attic, across the roof, and then up into the roof of the other, and with great difficulty, I managed to get her out. When she finally arrived, Heathcliff accompanied her and insisted that I take her into the kitchen, as my colleague had gone next door to escape the noise of our ""devil's song,"" as he called it."
"I told them I intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation.","I told them I had no intention of supporting their plans, but since the prisoner hadn't fasted since the previous day's dinner, I would wink at his treacherous Mr. Hindley this once. He lay down. I placed a stool by the fire and offered him many delicacies, but he felt sick and ate little, and my attempts to distract him failed. He leaned back, resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands, sank into silent meditation."
"On my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered gravely - 'I'm trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not die before I do!' 'For shame, Heathcliff!' said I. 'It is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to forgive.' 'No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned. 'I only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm thinking of that I don't feel pain.' 'But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.","When I asked him what he was thinking about, he replied seriously: ""I'm thinking about how to thank Hindley. It doesn't matter how long I wait, as long as I finally get there. I hope he doesn't die before I do!"" ""Shame on you, Heathcliff!"" I said. ""It is God's duty to punish the wicked; we must learn to forgive."" ""No, God won't feel as much satisfaction as I do,"" he replied. ""I wish I knew the best way! Leave me alone, I'll take care of it. While I'm thinking about it, I feel no pain."" ""But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget that these stories won't distract you."""
"I'm annoyed how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff's history, all that you need hear, in half a dozen words.' Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I was very far from nodding. 'Sit still, Mrs. Dean,' I cried; 'do sit still another half-hour. You've done just right to tell the story leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same style.","It annoys me that I can babble on so long; and your porridge is cold, and you fall asleep to go to bed! I could have told you the story of Heathcliff, all you needed, in half a dozen words. The housekeeper stopped, stood up, and laid down her needlework; but I felt unable to get up from the fire, and was far from nodding my head. ""Be quiet, Mrs. Dean!"" I cried; ""Be quiet for another half hour. You have told the story perfectly. That's how I like it; and you must finish it the same way."""
"I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or less.' 'The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.' 'No matter - I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.' 'You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the very prime of the morning gone long before that time.","I'm more or less interested in each of the characters you mentioned. — It's eleven o'clock, sir. — Never mind, I don't usually go to bed late at night. An hour or two is quite early for someone who sleeps until ten. — You shouldn't go to bed before ten. It's already past morning."
"A person who has not done one-half his day's work by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.' 'Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.' 'I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw - ' 'No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?' 'A terribly lazy mood, I should say.' 'On the contrary, a tiresomely active one.","Anyone who hasn't completed half their day's work by ten o'clock runs the risk of leaving the other half undone. ""Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, sit down again; for tomorrow I intend to prolong the night until noon. I certainly predict a persistent cold."" ""I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to be absent for about three years; in the meantime, Mrs. Earnshaw—"" ""No, no, I won't tolerate any such thing! Do you know in what state of mind you would be, if you were sitting alone, with the cat licking its kittens on the carpet before you, watching the operation with such attention that it would seriously bother you if the cat neglected even one ear?"" ""A terribly lazy state of mind, I should say."" ""On the contrary, a tedious task."""
"It is mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker-on. They DO live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external things.","That's my concern at the moment; so I'll go into detail. I notice that the people of these regions value the inhabitants of the cities as much as a spider in a dungeon values a spider in a hut, their various inhabitants; and yet this heightened attractiveness is not entirely due to the position of observer. They live more seriously, more inwardly, and less focused on superficial, changeable, and frivolous external things."
"I could fancy a love for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.' 'Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,' observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech. 'Excuse me,' I responded; 'you, my good friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class.","I had almost imagined a love here that would last a lifetime; and of a love that would last a whole year, I was a fervent skeptic. It is like serving a hungry man a single dish on which he can concentrate his entire appetite and give himself up to it completely; it is like leading him to a table laid by French cooks: he may perhaps derive equal pleasure from the whole; but each part is only an atom in his eyes and in his memory. ""Oh! We are like anywhere else here, once you get to know us,"" remarked Mrs. Dean, somewhat surprised by my speech. ""Excuse me,"" I replied; ""you, my dear friend, are a striking proof of the contrary. Apart from a few slight touches of provincialism, you show no trace of the manners I consider characteristic of your class."""
"I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.' Mrs. Dean laughed. 'I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' she said; 'not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor man's daughter.","I'm sure you've thought far more than most servants imagine. You've been forced to develop your mind because you've had no opportunity to waste your life on trivialities."" Mrs. Dean laughed. ""I certainly consider myself a sensible and judicious person,"" she said; ""not precisely because I live in the mountains and see the same faces and actions year after year; but I have maintained a strict discipline that has made me wise; and besides, I've read more than you think, Mr. Lockwood. You couldn't open a book in this library without my consulting and taking out something from it, unless it were Greek, Latin, and French; and I can do both: you can't expect more from a poor man's daughter."""
"However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next summer the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three years ago.' ON the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she ran. 'Oh, such a grand bairn!' she panted out. 'The finest lad that ever breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she's been in a consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.","But if I want to follow my narrative like a real chatterbox, I'd better continue; and instead of skipping three years, I'll simply jump to the following summer, the summer of 1778, almost 23 years ago. On a fine June day, my first beautiful little baby, and the last of the old Earnshaw line, was born. We were working hay in a distant field when the girl who usually brought us breakfast came running across the meadow and up the path an hour early and called to me. ""Oh, what a beautiful child!"" she gasped. ""The most beautiful boy that ever lived! But the doctor says the lady must go. He says she's been suffering from tuberculosis for months. I heard him say to Mr. Hindley, ""And now she has nothing to eat and will die before winter."""
"You must come home directly. You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!' 'But is she very ill?' I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet. 'I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.","You must go home immediately. You must take care of her, Nelly: give her sugar and milk and look after her day and night. I wish I were in your place, because she will be all yours when there is no woman left! ""But is she really sick?"" I asked, throwing down my rake and fastening my hood. ""I think so; but she looks brave,"" replied the girl, ""and she talks as if she dreams of seeing her as a man one day."""
"She's out of her head for joy, it's such a beauty! If I were her I'm certain I should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward, and says he - ""Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son.","She's overjoyed, what a beauty! If I were her, I certainly wouldn't die: the mere sight of her would heal me, despite Kenneth. I was furious at him. Lady Archer led the angel to the master of the house, and her face began to glow as the old prophet of doom stepped forward and said, ""Earnshaw, it's a blessing that your wife was spared and left you this son."""
"When she came, I felt convinced we shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will probably finish her. Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't be helped. And besides, you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass!""' 'And what did the master answer?' I inquired. 'I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the bairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously.","When she arrived, I was convinced we wouldn't have her long; and now I must tell you, the winter will probably exhaust her. Don't worry too much, don't worry too much: it's just the way it is. And besides, you should have known you wouldn't choose such a pretty girl! ""And what did the professor answer?"" I asked. ""I think he cursed, but that didn't bother me; I was so eager to see the child."" And she enthusiastically began her story all over again."
"I, as zealous as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for Hindley's sake. He had room in his heart only for two idols - his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't conceive how he would bear the loss. When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and, as I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby?' 'Nearly ready to run about, Nell!' he replied, putting on a cheerful smile. 'And the mistress?' I ventured to inquire; 'the doctor says she's - ' 'Damn the doctor!' he interrupted, reddening. 'Frances is quite right: she'll be perfectly well by this time next week.","Impatient as she was, I rushed home to admire it, though I felt very sorry for Hindley. In his heart, he had room for only two idols: his wife and himself. He cherished them both and worshipped one, and I couldn't imagine how he would cope with the loss. When we arrived at Wuthering Heights, he was standing in the doorway; and as we entered, I asked him, ""How has the baby been?"" ""Almost ready to run about, Nell!"" he replied with a cheerful smile. ""And the lady of the house?"" I ventured to ask. ""The doctor says she—"" ""Damn the doctor!"" he interrupted, blushing. ""Frances is quite right: she'll be better next week."""
"Are you going up-stairs? will you tell her that I'll come, if she'll promise not to talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she must - tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.' I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits, and replied merrily, 'I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!' Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her health improved every day.","Will you come up? Will you tell her I'll come if she promises not to say anything? I left her because she refused to be silent; and she must tell her that Mr. Kenneth has commanded her to be silent. I carried this news to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed cheerful and answered cheerfully, ""I have hardly said a word, Ellen, and now twice he has gone away crying. Now, tell him I promise not to say anything; but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!"" Poor soul! For a week after his death, she did not leave that cheerful heart; and her husband stubbornly, even angrily, maintained that her health was daily improving."
"When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not - she's well - she does not want any more attendance from you! She never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.' He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her - a very slight one - he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face changed, and she was dead. As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.","When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at this stage of the illness and that he shouldn't cost her any more, he replied: ""I know you don't need them; she's well; she doesn't need your care anymore! She never had tuberculosis. It was a fever, and that's gone: her pulse is now as slow as mine, and her cheek is just as cold."" He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one evening, as she leaned on his shoulder and said she thought she would be able to get up the next day, a slight cough came over her. He lifted her in his arms; she clasped her hands around his neck, her face changed, and she died. As the little girl had expected, little Hareton fell completely into my hands."
"Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation.","Mr. Earnshaw, for his part, was content, as long as he saw him well and never heard him cry. He himself was in despair; his grief was so great that it surpassed all complaint. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied; he cursed God and man and indulged in unbridled debauchery."
"The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.","The servants couldn't tolerate his tyrannical and evil behavior for long: Joseph and I were the only ones who wanted to stay. I couldn't bring myself to leave my post; besides, I had been his foster sister and, as a stranger, I was more likely to excuse his behavior. Joseph stayed to harass the peasants and workers; and because it was his calling to be where he had much evil to condemn."
"The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad WERE possessed of something diabolical at that period.","The Master's bad manners and bad friends set a good example for Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was so bad that he could transform a demon into a saint. And indeed, the boy did seem to have something diabolical about him at the time."
"He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception.","It gave him great pleasure to see Hindley humiliated beyond saving; and his barbaric sullenness and cruelty became more noticeable every day. I could hardly imagine the hell that reigned in our house. The minister canceled his visit, and eventually no one visited us anymore, except for Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy."
"At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.","At fifteen, she was the queen of the land; she was incomparable and proved to be a haughty and willful lady! I confess that after my childhood, I disliked her and often annoyed her by trying to curb her arrogance; but she never hated me. Their old ties were of wonderful constancy: even Heathcliff retained his unwavering affection; and young Linton, for all his superiority, found it difficult to make such an impression. He was my old man; there hangs his portrait over the fireplace."
"It used to hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what she was. Can you make that out? Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture.","It used to hang on one side and his wife's on the other; but his was taken down, otherwise it would have been visible. Do you see it? Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I saw a face with soft features, very like the young woman in The Heights, but with a more thoughtful and gentle expression. It was a pretty picture."
"The long light hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw. 'A very agreeable portrait,' I observed to the house-keeper. 'Is it like?' 'Yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.' Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first - for she was full of ambition - and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one.","Her long, fair hair, slightly curled at the temples, her large, serious eyes, her almost too graceful figure. It didn't surprise me that Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first boyfriend for such a person. On the other hand, I was surprised to see how, with his desire to please himself, he could shape the image I had of Catherine Earnshaw. ""A very pleasing portrait,"" I remarked to the housekeeper. ""Is that true?"" ""Yes,"" she replied; ""but he was most handsome when lively; that is his everyday appearance: he generally needed a lively air."" Catherine had kept in touch with the Lintons since her five weeks' stay with them; and, not tempted to be rude in their company, and ashamed to be impolite in the face of such unfailing courtesy, she unconsciously impressed the old lady and the old gentleman with her resourceful cordiality. had won Isabella's admiration and her brother's heart and soul: qualities that flattered her from the start – after all, she was full of ambition – and that led her to adopt a dual character, with no particular intention of deceiving anyone."
"In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a 'vulgar young ruffian,' and 'worse than a brute,' she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise. Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious, kept out of the way.","When she heard Heathcliff described as a ""common young villain"" and ""worse than a beast,"" she took care not to behave like him; at home, however, she was little inclined to civilities that would only provoke ridicule, nor to temper a fractious temper that would bring her neither honor nor praise. Mr. Edgar seldom found the courage to go openly to Wuthering Heights. Terrified by Earnshaw's reputation, he shrank from meeting him; yet he was always received with the utmost courtesy: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing his intentions; and when he could not be civil, he kept aloof."
"I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her. I've had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened into more humility.","I rather think that his presence was distasteful to Catherine; she was not clever, never played the coquette, and was definitely against the meeting of her two friends. For when Heathcliff expressed contempt for Linton in her presence, she could not bear it as half-heartedly as she did in his absence; and when Linton showed loathing and antipathy for Heathcliff, she dared not treat him indifferently, as if he cared little for his playmate's contempt. I have often laughed at her indescribable perplexity and perturbation, which she vainly endeavored to conceal from my ridicule. It seems cruel, but she was so proud that it became impossible for her to sympathize with his grief until she was brought to greater humility."
"She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser. Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.","Finally, she decided to confess her life to me and confide in me: she had no one else to turn to. Mr. Hindley had left home one afternoon, and Heathcliff had taken a holiday. He was, I believe, sixteen at the time, and without any unattractive features or lack of intelligence, he gave an impression of inner and outer repulsion of which his present appearance leaves no trace."
"In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books or learning. His childhood's sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former level.","First of all, he had lost the advantages of his early education: hard and constant work, beginning early and finishing late, had robbed him of all curiosity, all love of books and learning. The sense of superiority of his youth, instilled in him by the favor of old Mr. Earnshaw, was gone. For a long time he struggled to keep pace with Catherine's studies and gave up with deep, though silent, regret. But he gave himself up entirely; and nothing could induce him to go a step further when he found that he must necessarily fall behind his former level."
"Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance. Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and was then preparing to receive him. 'Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff. 'Are you going anywhere?' 'No, it is raining,' she answered. 'Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said. 'Nobody coming here, I hope?' 'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but you should be in the field now, Heathcliff.","Then his appearance was accompanied by a mental deterioration: he assumed a slow gait and an unworthy countenance; his natural reserve increased to an almost idiotic excess of antisocial melancholy; and he evidently took a malicious delight in exciting disgust rather than respect in his few acquaintances. He and Catherine were still his constant companions during his recesses; but he had ceased to express his affection for her in words and recoiled with furious distrust from her filial caresses, as if he knew that it would give her no satisfaction to lavish him with such marks of affection. On the occasion above mentioned, he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while I helped Miss Cathy to dress. She had not expected that he would think of being lazy; and, thinking she had the whole house to herself, she somehow managed to inform Mr. Edgar of his brother's absence and then prepared to receive him. ""Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?"" asked Heathcliff. ""Are you going anywhere?"" ""No, it's raining,"" she replied. ""Then why are you wearing that silk dress?"" he asked. ""I hope no one comes here?"" ""Not that I know of,"" stammered Miss. ""But you ought to be out in the fields, Heathcliff."""
"It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were gone.' 'Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the boy. 'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.' 'Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!' 'Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will take him till dark, and he'll never know.' So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows - she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion. 'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence. 'As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for no good.' 'Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I'm on the point, sometimes, of complaining that they - but I'll not - ' 'That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled countenance. 'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl! That's enough; let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about, Heathcliff?' 'Nothing - only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with me.","It's one o'clock after dinner: I thought you weren't here. ""Hindley doesn't often get rid of her accursed presence,"" the boy remarked. ""I have the day off: I'll stay with you."" ""Oh, but Joseph will tell you,"" she suggested; ""you'd better go! Joseph is loading lime from the other side of Penistone Crags; he'll be there all night and never know."" With that, he strolled to the fire and sat down. Catherine thought for a moment and frowned; she felt an urge to let an intruder pass. ""Isabella and Edgar Linton have been talking about coming this afternoon,"" she said after a minute's silence. ""On account of the rain, I don't expect them; but they might come, and if they do, you might be scolded for nothing."" ""Tell Ellen you're engaged, Cathy,"" he persisted. ""Don't exclude me from your miserable, idiotic list of friends!"" Sometimes I feel like complaining that she—but I don't—' 'That she—what?' cried Catherine, looking at him anxiously. 'Oh, Nelly!' she added irritably, pulling her head away from my hands, 'you tore up my curls while combing them! That's enough; leave me alone. What are you complaining about, Heathcliff?' 'Nothing—look at the almanac on the wall,' he said, pointing to a framed sheet hanging in the window, and continued: 'The crosses represent the evenings you spent with the Lintons, the dots those you spent with me.'"
"Do you see? I've marked every day.' 'Yes - very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish tone. 'And where is the sense of that?' 'To show that I DO take notice,' said Heathcliff. 'And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more irritated. 'What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, either!' 'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation. 'It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she muttered. Her companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summon she had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.","You see? I've been writing it down every day.' 'Yes, silly indeed: as if I noticed!' answered Catherine sullenly. 'And what's the point of that?' 'To show that I do notice,' said Heathcliff. 'And must I always sit by your side?' she demanded, growing more and more irritated. 'What's the point of that? What are you talking about? You must be a fool, or a child, with all the things you say to amuse me, or all the things you do!' 'You never told me that I don't talk enough, or that you don't like my company, Cathy!' cried Heathcliff excitedly. 'It isn't company at all when people don't know and don't say,' she murmured. Her companion rose, but he had no time to express his feelings further, for the sound of horse's hooves on the flagstones, and after a light knock, young Linton entered, his face beaming with joy at the unexpected visit she had received. Catherine undoubtedly noticed the difference between her friends, for one came in and the other left."
"The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and softer. 'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser. 'No,' answered Catherine. 'What are you doing there, Nelly?' 'My work, Miss,' I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.) She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'Take yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!' 'It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I'm sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.' 'I hate you to be fidgeting in MY presence,' exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff. 'I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation.","The contrast was like exchanging a desolate, hilly mining area for a beautiful, fertile valley; his voice and greeting were as contradictory as his appearance. He had a soft, deep voice and spoke his words as one might: less abruptly than here, and more gently. ""Haven't I come too early?"" he said, glancing at me. I had begun drying my plate and tidying some drawers on the other side of the dresser. ""No,"" Catherine replied. ""What are you doing here, Nelly?"" ""My work, miss,"" I replied. (Mr. Hindley had asked me to have a third person assist during Linton's private visits.) She stood behind me and whispered angrily, ""Take off your clothes and dusters; when there are people in the house, the servants don't start scrubbing and cleaning the room they're in!"" ""This is a good opportunity, now that the master is gone,"" I replied loudly. ""He can't stand it when I argue about such things in his presence. Mr. Edgar will surely forgive me."" ""I can't stand it when you argue in my presence,"" the young woman cried imperiously, without giving her guest a moment to speak. Since her little quarrel with Heathcliff, she hadn't been able to regain her composure. ""I'm sorry, Miss Catherine,"" I replied, diligently continuing with my work."
"She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm. I've said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick! You have no right to nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.' 'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze. 'What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her.","Thinking Edgar didn't see her, she tore the handkerchief from my hands and squeezed my arm long and hard. I told her I didn't love her and sometimes even enjoyed wounding her vanity; besides, she hurt me terribly. Then I jumped up and cried, ""Oh, miss, this is a dirty trick! You have no right to bite me, and I won't tolerate it."" ""I didn't touch you, you liar!"" she cried, her fingers tingling at the thought of repeating it, and her ears red with rage. She had never succeeded in concealing her passion; it always burned within her. ""What is it?"" I replied, with a determined, purple witness to refute her."
"She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water. 'Catherine, love! Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed. 'Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over. Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out complaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.","She stamped her foot, hesitated for a moment, and then, irresistibly driven by her inner malice, struck me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with tears. ""Catherine, my dear! Catherine!"" Linton interrupted, deeply shaken by his idol's double error of falsehood and violence. ""Get out of the room, Ellen!"" she repeated, trembling all over. Little Hareton, who had followed me everywhere and sat on the floor beside me, began to cry at the sight of my tears and complained about ""wicked Aunt Cathy,"" which brought his anger to his unhappy face. She seized him by the shoulders and shook him until the poor child was as white as chalk, and Edgar, without thinking, seized his hands to free him. In an instant, one of them came loose, and the young man was astonished to feel it brush against his ear in a way that could not be interpreted as a joke."
"He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip. 'That's right!' I said to myself. 'Take warning and begone! It's a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.' 'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.","He recoiled in alarm. I took Hareton in my arms and accompanied him into the kitchen. I left the connecting door open, curious to see how they would resolve their argument. The offended visitor, pale and with trembling lips, approached the spot where he had left his hat. ""Seriously!"" I said to myself. ""Warn me and get out of here! It's a nice gesture to give you a glimpse of his true self."" ""Where are you going?"" Catherine asked, heading for the door."
"He swerved aside, and attempted to pass. 'You must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically. 'I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice. 'No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all night, and I won't be miserable for you!' 'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Linton. Catherine was mute. 'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'I'll not come here again!' Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle. 'And you told a deliberate untruth!' he said. 'I didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'I did nothing deliberately.","He dodged and tried to get past her. ""You mustn't go!"" she cried forcefully. ""I must!"" he answered softly. ""No,"" she insisted, tightening the latch, ""not yet, Edgar Linton. Sit down, you mustn't leave me like this. I'll be miserable all night, and I won't do that to you!"" ""Can I stay after you hit me?"" Linton asked. Catherine was speechless. ""You frightened and shamed me,"" he continued. ""I'm not coming back here!"" Her eyes began to sparkle and her eyelids glitter. ""And you lied on purpose!"" he said. ""That wasn't me!"" she cried, finding her voice. ""I didn't do anything on purpose."""
"Well, go, if you please - get away! And now I'll cry - I'll cry myself sick!' She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there he lingered. I resolved to encourage him. 'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' I called out. 'As bad as any marred child: you'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve us.' The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten.","Go away, please go away! And now I'm crying, crying my eyes out! She fell to her knees beside a chair and began to cry, in all seriousness. Edgar held out until the tribunal; he stayed there for a while. I decided to encourage him. ""Mademoiselle is terribly stubborn, sir,"" I cried. ""As bad as a deformed child: you'd better go home, or she'll get sick and make us sad."" The friendly creature looked questioningly out the window: he had the power to leave, just as a cat has the power to leave a mouse half-dead or a bird half-eaten."
"Ah, I thought, there will be no saving him: he's doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy - had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess themselves lovers. Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.","Ah! I thought, he is beyond saving: he is damned and running to his doom! And so it happened: he turned abruptly, rushed back, and closed the door behind him; and when I returned a moment later to report that Earnshaw had come home drunk and ready to spill all about us (his usual state of mind under such circumstances), I saw that this quarrel had only increased their intimacy, shattered the facade of their youthful timidity, and enabled them to abandon their friendship and confess themselves as lovers. The news of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton to his horse and Catherine to her room. I went, hid little Hareton, and fetched the lead from the master's hunting harness, which in his wild excitement he played with so willingly, at the risk of anyone irritating him or even attracting him too much; and I had determined to take it off, that it might do less damage if it fired."
"HE entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act of stowing his son sway in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness or his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him. 'There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a dog. 'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black- horse marsh; and two is the same as one - and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!' 'But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has been cutting red herrings.","He came in, cursing and cursing hideously in my ear, and surprised me hiding his son in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was seized with a wholesome fear at the thought of being exposed to the affection or the frenzied rage of his wild animal; for in the one case he would probably be crushed and kissed to death, in the other thrown into the fire or dashed against the wall; and the poor creature lay perfectly still wherever I laid it. ""There, I've found him at last!"" cried Hindley, pulling me by the scruff of the neck like a dog. ""By God and hell, you've conspired to kill that child! Now I know why he always avoids me. But with Satan's help, I'll make you swallow the knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh, because I just stuffed Kenneth headfirst into Black Horse Marsh; and two is one—and I intend to kill some of them: I won't rest until I've done it!"" ""But I don't like the carving knife, Mr. Hindley,"" I replied; ""that's a red herring."""
"I'd rather be shot, if you please.' 'You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall. No law in England can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable! Open your mouth.' He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably - I would not take it on any account. 'Oh!' said he, releasing me, 'I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.","""I'd rather be shot, if that's all right with you."" ""You'd rather be damned!"" he said; ""and you will. No law in England can prevent a man from running his house decently, and mine is abominable! Open your mouth."" He had the knife in his hand and rammed the point between my teeth. But I had never been particularly afraid of his caprices. I spat it out, protesting that it tasted disgusting—I would not take it under any circumstances. ""Oh!"" he said, letting go of me, ""I see that horrible little villain is not Hareton. Forgive me, Nell."""
"If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin. Unnatural cub, come hither! I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce - get me a scissors - something fierce and trim! Besides, it's infernal affectation - devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears - we're asses enough without them.","If so, he deserves to be skinned alive for not running up to me screaming like I was a goblin. Little Denature, come here! I'll show you how to charm a good-natured and misguided father. Don't you think the boy would look better with a haircut? It makes a dog look wilder, and I like wilder things—give me some scissors—something wilder and tidier! Besides, it's a hellish invention—a devilish vanity—to pamper one's ears—we're stupid enough without them."
"Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my darling! wisht, dry thy eyes - there's a joy; kiss me. What! it won't? Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a monster! As sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.' Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him up- stairs and lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue him.","Hush, child, hush! Come, my darling! I wish you could dry your tears—what joy! Kiss me. What? Won't you? Kiss me, Hareton! Lord, kiss me! By God, as if I'd wake such a monster! As sure as I live, I'll break its neck. Poor Hareton howled and kicked with all his might in his father's arms, and screamed even louder as I carried him upstairs and over the banister. I screamed that he frightened the child, and I ran to save him."
"As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his hands. 'Who is that?' he asked, hearing some one approaching the stairs'-foot. I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell. There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe.","As I reached them, Hindley leaned over the railing to listen for a noise below; he had almost forgotten what he was holding. ""Who's there?"" he asked, hearing someone approaching the stairs. I, too, leaned forward and signaled to Heathcliff, whose footsteps I recognized, to stop. But no sooner had I taken my eyes off Hareton than he suddenly jumped up, freed himself from the casual grasp, and fell. We barely had time to shudder in horror when we saw that the little wreck was safe and sound."
"Heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge.","Heathcliff arrived at the right moment; with a natural movement, he arrested his fall, stood up, and looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has sold a lottery ticket for five shillings and finds the next day he has lost five thousand pounds could not wear a more gloomy face than at the sight of Mr. Earnshaw's figure looming over him. More clearly than words, it expressed the deepest fear of having been used as an instrument to thwart his own revenge."
"Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered and abashed. 'It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?' 'Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot! Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him. You're worse than a heathen - treating your own flesh and blood in that manner!' He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror directly.","Had it been dark, he would surely have tried to redeem himself by smashing Hareton's skull on the stairs. But we witnessed his rescue. Soon I was downstairs, clutching my precious burden to my heart. Hindley came down calmer, more sober, and more ashamed. ""It's your fault, Ellen,"" he said. ""You should have hidden him. You should have taken him away from me! Is he hurt anywhere?"" ""Hurt!"" I cried angrily. ""If he isn't killed, he's a fool! Oh! I wonder his mother doesn't rise from the grave to see how you treat him. You are worse than a heathen, treating your own flesh and blood thus!"" He tried to touch the child, who, upon finding herself near me, immediately began to sob to drive away her fear."
"At the first finger his father laid on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if he would go into convulsions. 'You shall not meddle with him!' I continued. 'He hates you - they all hate you - that's the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state you're come to!' 'I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man, recovering his hardness. 'At present, convey yourself and him away. And hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire: but that's as my fancy goes.' While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and poured some into a tumbler. 'Nay, don't!' I entreated. 'Mr. Hindley, do take warning.","But at the first finger his father touched, he screamed again, even louder than before, and writhed as if in convulsions. ""Don't worry about him!"" I continued. ""He hates you—everyone hates you—that's the truth! You have a happy family and you're well!"" ""I'll get better, Nelly,"" laughed the battered man, his hardness returning. ""Now go with him and you. And listen, Heathcliff! Get out of my sight and ears, too. I wouldn't kill you tonight unless I set fire to the house. But this is my idea."" As he said this, he took half a pint of brandy from the dresser and poured it into a glass. ""No, no!"" I pleaded. ""Mr. Hindley, be warned."""
"Have mercy on this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!' 'Any one will do better for him than I shall,' he answered. 'Have mercy on your own soul!' I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand. 'Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker,' exclaimed the blasphemer. 'Here's to its hearty damnation!' He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember. 'It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. 'He's doing his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.' I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep. Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.","""Pity this unfortunate fellow if you don't look after yourself!"" ""Anyone will look after him better than I,"" he replied. ""Pity your own soul!"" I said, trying to snatch the glass from his hand. ""Not I! On the contrary, it will be a great pleasure for me to send him to damnation as punishment for his Creator,"" cried the blasphemer. ""To his damnation!"" He drank the liquor and impatiently ordered us to leave; his command ended with a string of hideous curses too terrible to repeat or memorize. ""It's a pity he can't drink himself to death,"" remarked Heathcliff, muttering an echo of imprecations as the door closed. ""He does his best, but his constitution defies him."" ""Mr. Kenneth said he would bet his mare that she would outlive everyone this side of Gimmerton and go to the grave a gray-haired sinner; unless some lucky chance befell her, that is not her way. I went into the kitchen and sat down to put my lamb to sleep. Heathcliff, I thought, went into the barn."
"It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained silent. I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began, It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat, The mither beneath the mools heard that, when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her head in, and whispered, - 'Are you alone, Nelly?' 'Yes, Miss,' I replied. She entered and approached the hearth.","It turned out he hadn't left the cottage yet, as he threw himself onto a bench by the wall, away from the fire, and remained silent. I rocked Hareton on my knees and hummed a song that began, ""It was late at night, and the children were wailing."" The mother under the hats heard it when Miss Cathy, who had been listening to the commotion from her room, poked her head in and whispered, ""Are you alone, Nelly?"" ""Yes, miss,"" I answered. She went inside and walked to the fireplace."
"I, supposing she was going to say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.","I thought she was going to say something, so I looked up. Her expression seemed troubled and worried. Her lips were parted, as if she were about to say something, and she took a deep breath, but it wasn't a sentence, it was a sigh."
"I resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour. 'Where's Heathcliff?' she said, interrupting me. 'About his work in the stable,' was my answer. He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags.","I resumed my song; I hadn't forgotten her behavior. ""Where is Heathcliff?"" she interrupted. ""Because of his work in the stable,"" I replied. He didn't contradict me; perhaps he had fallen asleep. There was a long silence, during which I saw a drop or two trickle down Catherine's cheek and onto the flagstones."
"Is she sorry for her shameful conduct? - I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may come to the point - as she will - I sha'n't help her! No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns. 'Oh, dear!' she cried at last. 'I'm very unhappy!' 'A pity,' observed I. 'You're hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can't make yourself content!' 'Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it. 'Is it worth keeping?' I inquired, less sulkily. 'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've given him an answer.","Does she regret her shameful behavior? I wondered. It will be something new: but she could—and she will—I won't help her! No, she had nothing to fear except her own worries. ""Oh dear!"" she cried at last. ""I am very unhappy!"" ""What a pity,"" I remarked. ""You are difficult to please; so many friends and so few worries, and you can't manage to please yourself!"" ""Nelly, will you keep a secret from me?"" she continued, kneeling beside me and raising her enchanting eyes to me, the kind that drives away bad moods even when one has every right to do so. ""Is it worth it?"" I asked, less sullenly. ""Yes, and it worries me, and I must say so! I want to know what to do."" Today Edgar Linton proposed to me, and I said yes."
"Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.' 'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?' I replied. 'To be sure, considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.' 'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly rising to her feet. 'I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I was wrong!' 'You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have pledged your word, and cannot retract.' 'But say whether I should have done so - do!' she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning. 'There are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly,' I said, sententiously. 'First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?' 'Who can help it? Of course I do,' she answered. Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious. 'Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?' 'Nonsense, I do - that's sufficient.' 'By no means; you must say why?' 'Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.' 'Bad!' was my commentary. 'And because he is young and cheerful.' 'Bad, still.' 'And because he loves me.' 'Indifferent, coming there.' 'And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.' 'Worst of all.","Now, before I tell you whether it was approval or refusal, tell me what it should have been. ""Really, Miss Catherine, how should I know?"" I replied. ""Of course, considering the performance you made in his presence this afternoon, I should say it would be wise to decline: since he asked you about it, he must be either hopelessly stupid or a brazen fool."" ""If you talk like that, I'll tell you no more,"" she replied, rising sullenly. ""I accepted it, Nelly. Come, tell me if I was wrong!"" ""You accepted it! What's the use talking about it then? You've given your word and you can't go back on it."" ""But tell me if I should have!"" she cried irritably, rubbing her hands and frowning. ""There is much to consider before I can answer that question properly,"" I said pompously. ""Do you love Mr. Edgar?"" ""Who can stop me? Of course I do,"" she replied. Then I gave her the following catechism: For a twenty-two-year-old girl, that wasn't unreasonable. ""Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?"" ""Everything, I love him, that's enough."" ""Not at all; you must tell me why?"" ""Well, because he's handsome and a pleasure to be with."" ""Bad!"" I was about to reply. ""And because he's young and cheerful."" ""Still bad."" ""And because he loves me."" ""Never mind, I'll get there."" ""And he'll be rich, and I'll be happy to be the most respected woman in the neighborhood, and I'll be proud of such a husband."" ""The worst of all."""
"And now, say how you love him?' 'As everybody loves - You're silly, Nelly.' 'Not at all - Answer.' 'I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!' 'And why?' 'Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It's no jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire. 'I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,' I replied. 'You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you.","And now tell me, how do you love him? – Just as everyone loves him... You're crazy, Nelly. – Not at all... Answer me. – I love the earth beneath his feet, the air above his head, everything he touches, every word he says. I love every look in his eyes, every action, and everything about him. Right there! – And why? – No, you're joking: that's extremely wicked! It's no joke to me! said the young woman, frowning, and turning her face to the fire. – I'm not joking, Miss Catherine, I replied. You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, young, cheerful, rich, and loves you."
"The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the four former attractions.' 'No, to be sure not: I should only pity him - hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.' 'But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from loving them?' 'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.' 'You may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.' 'He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak rationally.' 'Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry Mr. Linton.' 'I don't want your permission for that - I SHALL marry him: and yet you have not told me whether I'm right.' 'Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.","This last point, however, is unnecessary: you would probably love him without him; and not with him either, unless he possessed the four preceding charms.—No, certainly not: I should only pity him, or even hate him, if he were ugly and a clown.—But there are other handsome and rich young men in the world: perhaps more handsome and rich than he. What should prevent you from loving them?—If there are, I avoid them: I never saw one like Edgar.—Perhaps you will be; and he will not always be handsome and young, and perhaps not always rich either.—He is now; and I have only to think about the present. I wish you would speak sensibly.—Well, that is all: if you only think about the present, marry Mr. Linton.—I need not ask your leave for that; I will marry her: and yet you have not told me whether I was right.—Quite right; if one marries only for the present."
"And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and easy: where is the obstacle?' 'HERE! and HERE!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast: 'in whichever place the soul lives.","And now tell us what makes you unhappy. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and the old man, I think, won't mind; you'll be leaving a chaotic and dreary house for a rich and decent one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. Everything seems simple and easy: where is the obstacle? ""HERE! And HERE!"" replied Katharina, striking her forehead with one hand and her chest with the other: ""Wherever the soul dwells."""
"In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!' 'That's very strange! I cannot make it out.' 'It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I can't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.' She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver, and her clasped hands trembled. 'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after some minutes' reflection. 'Yes, now and then,' I answered. 'And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.","Deep in my soul and heart, I am convinced I am wrong! – It is very strange! I cannot understand it. – It is my secret. But if you will not laugh at me, I will explain it to you: I cannot explain it exactly; but I will give you an idea of what I feel. She sat down beside me again; her face became sadder and more serious, and her clasped hands trembled. – Nelly, do you never have strange dreams? she said suddenly, after thinking for a few minutes. – Yes, from time to time, I answered. And I do too. In my life, I have had dreams that have always marked me and changed my thoughts: they have passed through me as wine through water, changing the color of my mind."
"And this is one: I'm going to tell it - but take care not to smile at any part of it.' 'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried. 'We're dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at little Hareton! HE'S dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!' 'Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and innocent.","And here's one: I'll tell it, but beware of smiling at him. ""Oh! Don't, Miss Catherine!"" I cried. ""We are sad enough without having to trouble ourselves with specters and visions. Come, come, be merry and be yourselves! Look at little Hareton! He has no dark dreams. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!"" ""Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his loneliness! You remember him, no doubt, when he was just as plump as this thing: almost as young and innocent."""
"However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.' 'I won't hear it, I won't hear it!' I repeated, hastily. I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was vexed, but she did not proceed.","But Nelly, I'll force you to listen to me. It won't be long, and tonight I lack the strength to be cheerful. ""I won't listen to her, I won't listen to her!"" I repeated hastily. ""I was superstitious about dreams then, and I still am. And Catherine had an unusual sadness that made me fear something from which I might draw a prophecy and foretell a terrible catastrophe."" She was annoyed, but she didn't pursue it further."
"Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. 'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.' 'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered. 'All sinners would be miserable in heaven.' 'But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.' 'I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'll go to bed,' I interrupted again. She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair. 'This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.","Apparently she changed the subject, because she immediately continued: ""If I were in Heaven, Nelly, I would be terribly unhappy."" ""Because you weren't made for it,"" I replied. ""All sinners would be unhappy in Heaven."" ""But that's not true. I once dreamed I was there."" ""I tell you, I don't listen to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'm going to bed,"" I interrupted again. She laughed and hugged me tightly, for I made to get up. ""It's nothing,"" she cried. ""I only meant that Heaven didn't seem to be my home; and I was moved to tears when I came back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they threw me down among the heather on the top of Wuthering Heights, where I woke up sobbing with joy."""
"That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other. I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am.","That explains my secret, as well as the other. I have no reason to marry Edgar Linton, any more than there is in heaven; and if that vile man hadn't wounded Heathcliff so deeply, I wouldn't have thought of it. It would be humiliating for me to marry Heathcliff now; he'll never know how much I love him: and that's not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more like me than I am."
"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.' Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence. Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no further.","Whatever our souls may be, his and mine are identical; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire. Before I had even finished this speech, I felt Heathcliff's presence. I noticed a slight movement, turned my head, and saw him rise from the sofa and walk away in silence. He had listened until Catherine said that marrying her would humiliate him, and then he stood there and listened no more."
"My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I started, and bade her hush! 'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round. 'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road; 'and Heathcliff will come in with him. I'm not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.' 'Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door!' said she. 'Give me Hareton, while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that Heathcliff has no notion of these things.","My companion was sitting on the floor and couldn't notice his presence or departure through the arm of the sofa. I jumped up and told her to be quiet! ""Why?"" she asked, looking around nervously. ""Joseph is here,"" I replied, hearing the rumble of his wheels on the street at just the right moment. ""And Heathcliff is coming in with him. I'm not sure he isn't standing at the door right now."" ""Oh, he didn't hear me at the door!"" she said. ""Give me Hareton while you prepare dinner, and when it's ready, invite me to dinner. I want to ease my guilty conscience and convince myself that Heathcliff knows nothing about such things."""
"He has not, has he? He does not know what being in love is!' 'I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' I returned; 'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and love, and all! Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss Catherine - ' 'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of indignation. 'Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that's not what I intend that's not what I mean! I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded! He'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.","Hasn't he, has he? He doesn't know what it is to be in love! 'I see no reason why he shouldn't, just as you do,' I replied. 'And if he chooses you, he will be the unhappiest creature that ever lived! The moment you are Mrs. Linton, he will lose his friend, his love, and everything! Have you considered how you will bear the separation, and how he will bear being utterly abandoned to the world? For, Miss Catherine—' 'He is utterly deserted! We are separated!' she cried indignantly. 'Who will, pray, separate us? You will suffer the same fate as Milo! Not in my lifetime, Ellen: not for any mortal being. All the Lintons on earth may vanish before I consent to leave Heathcliff. Oh, I don't mean that, I don't mean that!' I wouldn't be Mrs. Linton if such a price were exacted from me! He will mean as much to me as he did his entire life."
"Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother's power.' 'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked. 'You'll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of young Linton.' 'It is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best! The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him.","Edgar must put aside his dislike and at least tolerate him. He will do so when he learns my true feelings for him. Nelly, I see now that you think me a selfish villain; but has it never occurred to you that we would be beggars if Heathcliff and I were married? If I married Linton, I could help Heathcliff to his feet and free him from my brother's grasp. ""With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?"" I asked. ""You will find him not as docile as you think; and though I find it difficult to judge, I consider this the worst reason you ever gave for becoming young Linton's wife."" ""It is not,"" she replied, ""it is the best! The others were the gratification of my caprices, and also for Edgar's sake, to appease him."""
"This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself.","This is for someone who understands my feelings for Edgar and myself personally. I cannot express them in words; but surely you, like everyone else, believe that there is, or should be, an existence outside yourself? What would my creation have been of use if I had been entirely absorbed in it? My greatest misfortune in this world was Heathcliff's misfortune, and I have experienced and felt them all from the beginning: my greatest thought in life is him."
"If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. - My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.","If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still exist; and if all else remained, and HE were destroyed, the universe were turned into a mighty stranger: I should not belong to it.—My love for Linton is like the leaves of the wood: time will change it, I know, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff is like the eternal rocks that cover it: a source of seemingly small joy, but necessary none the less. Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He is always, always on my mind: not as a joy, any more than I am always a joy to myself, but as my own being."
"So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and - ' She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly! 'If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble me with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.' 'You'll keep that?' she asked, eagerly. 'No, I'll not promise,' I repeated.","Then speak no more of our separation: it is impracticable; and—"" She paused and buried her face in the folds of my dress; but I tore it violently. My patience with her nonsense was at an end! ""If I can understand your nonsense, Mademoiselle,"" I said, ""it only convinces me that you do not know the duties you assume in marriage; or that you are a wicked and unscrupulous girl. But do not burden me with further secrets: I do not promise to keep them."" ""Will you keep them?"" she asked eagerly. ""No, I do not promise,"" I repeated."
"She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn't settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone. 'And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time? What is he about? girt idle seeght!' demanded the old man, looking round for Heathcliff. 'I'll call him,' I replied. 'He's in the barn, I've no doubt.' I went and called, but got no answer.","She wanted to insist, but Joseph's arrival interrupted our conversation. Catherine pushed her chair into a corner and looked after Hareton while I prepared dinner. When the meal was ready, my colleague and I began to discuss who should take what to Mr. Hindley; and we were only able to settle the matter when everything was almost cold. Then we agreed to ask him if he wanted anything, as we felt particularly brave enough to speak to him after a while of solitude. ""And how can he not be back from the field yet? What is he doing? He's dirty!"" asked the old man, looking for Heathcliff. ""I'll call him,"" I replied. ""He's in the barn, I'm sure of it."" I tried to call him, but received no answer."
"On returning, I whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother's conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we should wait no longer.","When I returned, I whispered to Catherine that he must have heard much of what she had said. And I told him how I had seen him coming out of the kitchen just as she was complaining about her brother's behavior. She flinched, threw Hareton onto the sofa, and ran off to find her friend. She gave no thought to her excitement or to the effect her words might have had on him. She had been gone so long that Joseph thought they shouldn't wait any longer."
"He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They were 'ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,' he affirmed. And on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly! 'I want to speak to him, and I MUST, before I go upstairs,' she said. 'And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.' Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked grumbling forth.","He had a sneaking suspicion that they were wandering off to avoid his long and drawn-out benediction. ""That was enough for a few discourtesies,"" he claimed. And for them, that evening, he added a special prayer to the usual fifteen minutes of supplication before dinner, and he would have added another at the end, had not his young mistress surprised him by hastily bidding him go down the road and find Heathcliff, wherever he might have gone, and bring him back at once! ""I want to speak to him, and I MUST before I go up,"" she said. ""And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of earshot; for he has not answered, though I called with all my might from the sheepfold."" Joseph protested at first; but she was too earnest to be contradicted; and at last he put on his hat and muttered."
"Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming - 'I wonder where he is - I wonder where he can be! What did I say, Nelly? I've forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him? I do wish he'd come. I do wish he would!' 'What a noise for nothing!' I cried, though rather uneasy myself. 'What a trifle scares you! It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft.","Meanwhile, Catherine paced the room, crying. ""Where is he? Where could he possibly be? What did I say, Nelly? I've forgotten. Did my bad temper upset him this afternoon? My dear! Tell me, what did I say to hurt him? I wish he would come. I wish he would come!"" ""What a racket!"" I cried, though I was a little worried myself. ""What a terrible thing! There's no need to worry about Heathcliff running across the moor in the moonlight or being too grumpy to talk to us in the hayloft."""
"I'll engage he's lurking there. See if I don't ferret him out!' I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and Joseph's quest ended in the same. 'Yon lad gets war und war!' observed he on re-entering. 'He's left th' gate at t' full swing, and Miss's pony has trodden dahn two rigs o' corn, and plottered through, raight o'er into t' meadow! Hahsomdiver, t' maister 'ull play t' devil to-morn, and he'll do weel. He's patience itsseln wi' sich careless, offald craters - patience itsseln he is! Bud he'll not be soa allus - yah's see, all on ye! Yah mun'n't drive him out of his heead for nowt!' 'Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?' interrupted Catherine. 'Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?' 'I sud more likker look for th' horse,' he replied. 'It 'ud be to more sense.","I'll wait for him there. Let's see if I can't find him! I resumed my search; the result was disappointment, and Joseph's ended the same way. ""That boy will have war and war!"" he remarked as he came in. ""He opened the gate, and Miss's pony lifted two rows of corn and climbed right through it, right into the middle of the field! Hahsomdiver, the master, will face hell on earth tomorrow, and he'll do well. He has patience even with such careless, filthy craters—what patience he has himself! But he won't be so hungry—you see, it's all yours! You won't get him out of your head for nothing!"" ""Have you found Heathcliff, donkey?"" interrupted Catherine. ""Have you looked for him as I ordered?"" ""I'd rather look for the horse,"" he replied. ""That would be more logical."""
"Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this - as black as t' chimbley! und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at MY whistle happen he'll be less hard o' hearing wi' YE!' It WAS a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However, Catherine would hot be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying outright.","But I can find a Nordic horse, not quite so—as black as Chimbley! And Heathcliff, no, let the fellow come to my whistle, and he'll hear better with you! It was a very dark summer evening; the clouds seemed to be gathering into a storm, and I said we had better sit down; the approaching rain would surely bring him home without further trouble. Catherine, however, could not be pacified. She wandered restlessly from door to door, in a state of agitation that brooked no repose; and at last she settled down permanently on one side of the wall near the road: where, ignoring my warnings, the rumble of thunder and the large drops that began to patter around her, she called now and then, then listened, then cried aloud."
"She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying. About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire.","She would have made Hareton, or any other child, burst into tears. Around midnight, while we were still awake, a storm broke out on the Heights. A fierce wind and thunder raged, and one of them tore a tree from the corner of the building; a huge branch fell on the roof and tore down part of the east chimney, throwing stones and soot into the kitchen fire."
"We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living.","We thought lightning had struck us. Joseph fell to his knees and begged the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot and, as He had once done, to spare the righteous, even though He had struck down the wicked. I sensed that this must be a judgment for us as well. Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the door of his cave to see if he was still alive."
"He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawl-less to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands before it. 'Well, Miss!' I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 'you are not bent on getting your death, are you? Do you know what o'clock it is? Half-past twelve.","He answered in a fairly audible voice, in a manner that made my companion scream even louder than before, so that it was possible to clearly distinguish saints like him from sinners like his master. But the commotion subsided after twenty minutes, and we all left unharmed, except for Cathy, who was soaked to the skin because she stubbornly refused to seek shelter and, without a hat or shawl, to collect as much water as possible in her hair and clothes. She went inside and lay down on the sofa, completely soaked, turned her face back, and placed her hands on it. ""Come on now, Miss!"" I cried, touching her shoulder. ""You're not here to die, are you? Do you know what time it is? Twelve thirty."""
"Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy: he'll be gone to Gimmerton, and he'll stay there now. He guesses we shouldn't wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd rather avoid having the door opened by the master.' 'Nay, nay, he's noan at Gimmerton,' said Joseph. 'I's niver wonder but he's at t' bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn't for nowt, and I wod hev' ye to look out, Miss - yah muh be t' next.","Come to bed! We needn't wait any longer for the damned boy: he's gone to Gimmerton and is staying there. He supposes we shouldn't expect him until this late hour; at least, he supposes only Mr. Hindley is still up; and he would rather the master hadn't opened the door. ""No, no, he's not at Gimmerton,"" said Joseph. ""No wonder he's sitting in the bog. This visit has been in vain, and I beg you, be careful, miss; you're next."""
"Thank Hivin for all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro' th' rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.' And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them. I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.","Thank you, Hivin, for everything! Cooperation is good for them, as it should be, and it's so easy! You know how to find the Scriptures."" And he began quoting various texts, telling us the chapters and verses where we could find them. After vainly pleading with the wayward girl to get up and take off her wet clothes, I left him preaching and trembling and went to bed with little Hareton, who fell asleep as soundly as if everyone around him were asleep. I heard Joseph reading further a little later; then I heard his slow footsteps on the ladder and fell asleep."
"Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy. 'What ails you, Cathy?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?' 'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.' 'Oh, she is naughty!' I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably sober. 'She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir.' Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. 'The night through,' he repeated. 'What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was over hours since.' Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said nothing.","Coming downstairs a little later than usual, I saw, by the rays of sunlight peeping through the cracks in the shutters, that Miss Catherine was still sitting by the fire. The front door was also ajar; the light fell through the open windows; Hindley had gone out and was standing, exhausted and sleepy, over the kitchen fire. ""What is the matter, Cathy?"" he asked as I came in. ""You look as gloomy as a drowned bear. Why are you so pale and wet, girl?"" ""I was wet,"" she answered reluctantly, ""and I'm cold, that's all."" ""Oh, she's naughty!"" I exclaimed, perceiving that the gentleman was sober. ""She was wet from the rain last night, and she lay there all night, and I couldn't shake her off."" Mr. Earnshaw looked at us in astonishment. ""All night,"" he repeated. ""What kept her awake? Surely not fear of thunder?"" That was hours ago. Neither of us wanted to mention Heathcliff's absence as long as we could hide it. So I replied, ""I don't know how she had the courage to sit up."" And she said nothing."
"The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the window. I'm starving!' And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers. 'She's ill,' said Hindley, taking her wrist; 'I suppose that's the reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don't want to be troubled with more sickness here.","The morning was fresh and clear; I opened the shutter, and soon the sweet scent of the garden filled the room. But Catherine called to me grumpily, ""Ellen, close the window! I'm starving!"" Her teeth chattered as she approached the almost extinguished embers. ""She's ill,"" said Hindley, taking her wrist. ""I suppose that's why she didn't want to go to bed. Damn it! I don't want any more sickness here."""
"What took you into the rain?' 'Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. 'If I war yah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle and simple! Never a day ut yah're off, but yon cat o' Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo's a fine lass! shoo sits watching for ye i' t' kitchen; and as yah're in at one door, he's out at t'other; and, then, wer grand lady goes acourting of her side! It's bonny behaviour, lurking amang t' fields, after twelve o' t' night, wi' that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think I'M blind; but I'm noan: nowt ut t' soart! - I seed young Linton boath coming and going, and I seed YAH' (directing his discourse to me), 'yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t' maister's horse-fit clatter up t' road.' 'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was I who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were.' 'You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not he afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business this very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.' 'I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him.","What brought you out into the rain? ""You're running after those boys, like always!"" croaked Joseph, taking advantage of our hesitation to use his sharp tongue. ""If I were you, sir, I'd just smash them on the head with a plank! Not a day goes by when you're away without Linton's cat sneaking in; and Miss Nelly, she's a pretty girl! She waits for you in the kitchen; and when you go in by one door, he goes out by the other; and then our great lady is gone! What pretty behavior, creeping about the fields like this after midnight with that dirty, fawning gypsy Heathcliff! They take me for blind; but I'm a nobody: nothing to be exorcised!"" ""I see young Linton coming and going, and I see YAH (turning to me): 'YAH plays in vain, you careless witch!'"" ""Go quickly upstairs and rush into the house, just as you hear the master's horse rattle in the street."" ""Hush, you indiscreet woman!"" cried Catherine. ""Don't be so impertinent to me! Edgar Linton happened to be passing by yesterday, Hindley; and it was I who rebuked him, for I knew you would not have liked to see him thus."" ""You are lying, Cathy, I'm sure you are,"" replied her brother, ""and you are a damned fool! But leave Linton alone for a moment: Tell me, were you not at Heathcliff's last night? Tell the truth now. You needn't be afraid of hurting him. Although I hate him just as much, he recently did me a service that will give me remorse. To prevent that, I'll send him out this morning; and when he's gone, I advise you all to stay dry; then I'll be even funnier to you."" ""I didn't see Heathcliff last night,"" Catherine answered, beginning to sob bitterly, ""and if you send him out, I'll go with him."""
"But, perhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he's gone.' Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate. Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing! I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run for the doctor.","But perhaps you will never have the opportunity; perhaps he has gone away."" Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the rest of her words were unintelligible. Hindley showered her with a torrent of contemptuous insults and ordered her to return to her room immediately, or she would not weep in vain! I forced her to obey, and I will never forget the sight she presented to us when she arrived in her room: it frightened me. I thought she was going mad and asked Joseph to send for the doctor."
"It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage. Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it through.","This was the beginning of a delirium: As soon as Mr. Kenneth saw her, he declared her gravely ill; she had a fever. He took her blood and told me to keep her alive with a porridge of whey and water and to make sure she didn't throw herself down the stairs or out of the window. Then he left; he had enough to do in the community, where the individual houses were usually three or four kilometers apart. Although I was not exactly a kind nurse, and Joseph and the Lord were no better, and our patient was as annoying and stubborn as one could be, she survived."
"Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other. Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier than ever.","Old Mrs. Linton visited us several times, correcting us, scolding us, and bossing us around. When Catherine recovered, she insisted on taking her to Thrushcross Grange, for which we were very grateful. But the poor lady had reason to regret her kindness: she and her husband both fell ill with a fever and died within a few days. Our young wife returned more impudent, passionate, and arrogant than ever."
"Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period, for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.","Since the stormy night, there had been no news of Heathcliff; and one day, after she had provoked me violently, I had the misfortune to blame her for his disappearance—in her place, as she knew only too well. From then on, and for several months, she had no further contact with me except as a simple servant. Joseph, too, fell under her spell: he told her what he thought and lectured her like a little girl; she considered herself a woman and our mistress and believed that her recent illness justified respectful treatment."
"Then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.","The doctor had declared at the time that she would tolerate no great injustice; she must have her own way; and that in her eyes it was murder if anyone dared to contradict her. She kept her away from Mr. Earnshaw and his companions; and under Kenneth's guidance, and with stern threats that often accompanied his tantrums, her brother granted her all she wanted and generally avoided irritating her hot temper. He was rather indulgent in his indulgences; not from affection, but from pride: he ardently desired that she should do honor to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she left him alone, she could trample us all down like slaves, he cared little! Edgar Linton, like many before and after him, was madly in love: and he considered himself the happiest man in the world on the day he conducted her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years after her father's death."
"Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and accompany her here, Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother.","Very reluctantly, I allowed myself to be persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and accompany him here. Little Hareton was almost five years old, and I had only just begun to teach him to read. We said our goodbyes sadly, but Catherine's tears were stronger than ours. When I refused, seeing that her pleas did not move me, she went to her husband and brother with a sad face."
"The former offered me munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him! At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one.","The first offered me a generous salary; the second ordered me to leave: he wanted no more women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as for Hareton, the vicar would soon overpower him. So I had only one choice: to obey. I explained to the master that he wanted to get rid of all honest people in order to ruin himself even more quickly; I kissed Hareton and took my leave; and since then he has become a stranger to me: and it is very strange, but I have no doubt that he has completely forgotten Ellen Dean, and that he has always been more precious to her, and she to him! At this point in her story, the housekeeper glanced at the clock above the mantelpiece and was surprised to see the minute hand pointing to half past one."
"She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs. A CHARMING introduction to a hermit's life! Four weeks' torture, tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring! Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.","She would not stay a moment longer: to tell the truth, I was rather inclined to postpone the continuation of her narrative. And now that she has vanished to her resting place, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go thither too, in spite of the painful torpor of my head and limbs. A charming introduction to the life of a hermit! Four weeks of torture, tossing and turning, and sickness! Oh, these biting winds, this biting northern sky, these impassable roads, and these slow country doctors! And oh, this absence of human faces! And, worst of all, Kenneth's dreadful intimation that I should not come out again until spring! Mr. Heathcliff has just graced me with his visit."
"About seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse - the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is quite an easy interval.","About seven days ago, he sent me some grouse—the last of the season. What a scoundrel! He's not entirely innocent of my illness; and I was anxious to tell him so. But alas! How could I offend a man who was kind enough to sit by my bed for an hour and talk about something other than pills and medicines, blisters and leeches? It's a rather pleasant time."
"I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes: I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; and the heroine was married.","I'm too weak to read, but I think I could read something interesting. Why don't we let Mrs. Dean finish her story? I still remember the key events and how far she's come. Yes, I remember that her hero ran away and wasn't heard from for three years; and that the heroine got married."
"I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came. 'It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,' she commenced. 'Away, away with it!' I replied; 'I desire to have - ' 'The doctor says you must drop the powders.' 'With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.","I'll call her; she'll be pleased to hear I'm having a good time. Mrs. Dean came in. ""It takes twenty minutes, sir, to take the medicine,"" she began. ""Take it off!"" I replied. ""I wish—"" ""The doctor says you must stop taking the powders."" ""With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and sit here."""
"Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting out of your pocket - that will do - now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he get a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English highways?' 'He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I couldn't give my word for any.","Keep your hands off this bitter bottle phalanx. Take your knitting out of your pocket—it's enough—and pick up Mr. Heathcliff's story right where you left off, up to the present day. Did he finish his studies on the Continent and return a gentleman? Or did he secure a position as a sazar at the university, or did he escape to America and earn distinction there by spilling the blood of his host country? Or did he make his fortune more quickly on the English streets? ""He may have achieved something in all those professions, Mr. Lockwood; but I can vouch for none of them."""
"I stated before that I didn't know how he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your leave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?' 'Much.' 'That's good news.' I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to expect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.","I have already said that I did not know how he came by his money; nor did I know the means by which he extricated himself from the barbarous ignorance into which he had fallen. But, with your permission, I will proceed in my own way, if you think it will amuse and not tire you. 'Are you better this morning?' 'Very well.' 'That is good news.' I drove Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my great disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I had dared to hope. She seemed almost too enthusiastic about Mr. Linton; and even towards her sister she showed much affection."
"They were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour.","Both were deeply concerned for each other's well-being. It wasn't the thorn that leaned toward the honeysuckle, but the honeysuckle that embraced it. Neither side made any concessions: one stood firm, the others gave in. And who can be choleric and quick-tempered when they encounter neither resistance nor indifference? I sensed that Mr. Edgar was very afraid of disturbing them."
"He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it.","He concealed it from her; but whenever he heard me answer sharply, or saw another servant indignant at some peremptory order of his, he showed his displeasure by a frown that never darkened, even when directed at himself alone. Often he rebuked me severely for my insolence, declaring that a knife-thrust could not be more painful than the one he felt when he saw his lady so angry. In order not to anger a kind gentleman, I learned to be less irritable; and for six months the powder remained as harmless as sand, for there was no fire nearby to kindle it."
"Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.","Catherine sometimes experienced periods of depression and silence. Her husband respected them with approving silence, attributing them to a change in her constitution caused by her serious illness; she had never before been discouraged. He welcomed the return of the sun as an answer to her own. I think I can say that they truly felt a deep and growing happiness."
"It ended. Well, we MUST be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not the chief consideration in the other's thoughts. On a mellow evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering.","It's over. Well, in the long run, you have to look after yourself; the meek and generous are, quite rightly, more selfish than the dominant; and it's over when circumstances make you feel that the other person's well-being isn't your primary concern. One quiet September evening, I came out of the garden carrying a heavy basket full of apples I'd picked."
"It had got dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me say, - 'Nelly, is that you?' It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps.","Dusk was falling, and the moon shone brightly on the high courtyard wall, casting indistinct shadows on the many overhangs of the building. I laid my burden on the steps by the kitchen door, rested a moment, and took one last deep breath of the sweet, sweet air. Gazing up at the moon, with my back to the door, I heard a voice behind me say, ""Nelly, is that you?"" It was a deep voice with a strange ring; yet something in the way I pronounced my name made it sound familiar. I turned anxiously to see who was speaking; for the doors were closed, and I had seen no one as I approached the steps."
"Something stirred in the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. 'Who can it be?' I thought. 'Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no resemblance to his.' 'I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; 'and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I dared not enter.","Something moved on the porch. As I approached, I saw a tall man, dressed in black, with a black face and black hair. He was leaning against the side, his fingers on the latch, as if he were about to open the door himself. ""Who could that be?"" I wondered. ""Mr. Earnshaw? Oh no! His voice doesn't sound like his own at all."" ""I've been waiting here for an hour,"" he continued, as I continued to stare. ""And the whole time, everything has been completely silent. I haven't dared go in."""
"You do not know me? Look, I'm not a stranger!' A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular. I remembered the eyes. 'What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement. 'What! you come back? Is it really you? Is it?' 'Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within. 'Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word with her - your mistress.","Don't you know me? Look, I'm no stranger! A ray of sunlight illuminated his face; his cheeks were pale and half-covered with black sideburns; his eyebrows drooped, his eyes deep and strange. I remembered his eyes. ""What!"" I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and threw my hands in astonishment. ""What! Are you back? Really? Really?"" ""Yes, Heathcliff,"" he answered, looking alternately at me and the windows, in which twenty glittering moons were reflected, but no light shone. ""Are they home? Where is she? Nelly, you're not happy! Don't worry so much. Is she there? Speak! I want to speak to her, to your mistress."""
"Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.' 'How will she take it?' I exclaimed. 'What will she do? The surprise bewilders me - it will put her out of her head! And you ARE Heathcliff! But altered! Nay, there's no comprehending it. Have you been for a soldier?' 'Go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently. 'I'm in hell till you do!' He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the door.","""Go and tell them someone from Gimmerton wants to see her."" ""How will she react?"" I cried. ""What will she do? I'm completely astonished: she'll go mad! And you, you're Heathcliff! But different! No, this is inconceivable. Were you a soldier?"" ""Go and deliver my message,"" he interrupted impatiently. ""I'll be in hell until you do!"" He undid the latch, and I went in; but when I reached the parlor where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were sitting, I couldn't bring myself to go any further. Finally, I decided to ask them to light the candles, under the pretext of lighting them, and opened the door."
"They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously peaceful.","They sat together at a window whose latticework leaned against the wall. Beyond the garden trees and the wild, green park lay the Gimmerton Valley, through which a long layer of mist wound its way almost to the top (for just beyond the chapel, as you may have noticed, the marsh brook joins a stream that follows the meandering glen). Above this silvery mist loomed Wuthering Heights; our old house, however, was invisible; it leaned toward the other side. The room, its inhabitants, and the landscape they beheld seemed strangely peaceful."
"I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter, 'A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.' 'What does he want?' asked Mrs. Linton. 'I did not question him,' I answered. 'Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea. I'll be back again directly.' She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was. 'Some one mistress does not expect,' I replied. 'That Heathcliff - you recollect him, sir - who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's.' 'What! the gipsy - the ploughboy?' he cried. 'Why did you not say so to Catherine?' 'Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said. 'She'd be sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.","I shrank from my errand; I was about to leave without saying anything, after asking my question about the candles, when, realizing my folly, I turned and whispered, ""Someone from Gimmerton wants to see you, madam."" ""What does he want?"" asked Mrs. Linton. ""I didn't ask him,"" I answered. ""Well, draw the curtains, Nelly,"" she said, ""and bring in the tea. I'll be back in a moment."" She left the apartment; Mr. Edgar casually asked who it was. ""Someone a mistress doesn't expect to see,"" I answered. ""That Heathcliff—you remember him, sir, who lived with Mr. Earnshaw."" ""What? The gypsy—the ploughman?"" he cried. ""Why didn't you tell Catherine?"" ""Hush! You mustn't call her that, madam,"" I said. ""She would be very sorry. She was almost sad when he ran away."""
"I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.' Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'Don't stand there, love! Bring the person in, if it be anyone particular.' Ere long, I heard the click of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have surmised an awful calamity. 'Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. 'Oh, Edgar darling! Heathcliff's come back he is!' And she tightened her embrace to a squeeze. 'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that! He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.","""I suppose his return will give him great joy."" Mr. Linton went to a window on the other side of the room, which looked out into the courtyard. He unlocked it and leaned out. I suppose they were downstairs, for he immediately called out, ""Don't stay, my dear! Show the person in if it's someone special."" Then I heard the latch click, and Catherine ran upstairs, breathless and beside herself, too excited to show her joy: from her expression, one might have expected some dreadful disaster. ""Oh, Edgar, Edgar!"" she gasped, flinging her arms around his neck. ""Oh, Edgar, my darling! Heathcliff is back, he's back!"" And she hugged him tighter. ""Now, now!"" cried her husband angrily, ""don't strangle me for this! He was never such a wonderful darling to me."""
"There is no need to be frantic!' 'I know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the intensity of her delight. 'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come up?' 'Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?' 'Where else?' she asked. He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him.","""Don't panic!"" ""I know you didn't like him,"" she replied, suppressing her joy a little. ""But for me, you have to be friends now. Should I ask him to come upstairs?"" ""Here,"" he said, ""in the living room?"" ""Where else?"" she asked. He seemed irritated and suggested the kitchen, a more suitable place."
"Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression - half angry, half laughing at his fastidiousness. 'No,' she added, after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders. Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If so, give directions.","Mrs. Linton gave her a funny look, half angry, half laughing at her precision. ""No,"" she added after a moment, ""I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, who are of the nobility, and the other for Heathcliff and me, who are of the lower classes. Is that all right, my dear? Or should I have a fire lit elsewhere? If so, please give me instructions."""
"I'll run down and secure my guest. I'm afraid the joy is too great to be real!' She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her. 'YOU bid him step up,' he said, addressing me; 'and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.' I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently anticipating an invitation to enter.","I'll hurry downstairs and escort my guest safely home. I'm afraid the joy is too great to be true! She was about to run away again, but Edgar held her back. ""Invite him in,"" he said, turning to me. ""And Catherine, try to be cheerful without appearing foolish. The whole household doesn't need to see you welcoming a runaway servant like a brother."" I went downstairs and found Heathcliff waiting on the veranda, obviously eager to come in."
"He followed my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.","He followed my instructions without hesitation, and I led him to the gentleman and lady, whose rosy cheeks betrayed a cordial conversation. But the lady beamed in a different mood when her friend appeared on the threshold: She sprang forward, took his hands, and led him to Linton; then she grasped Linton's hesitant fingers and pressed them to hers. Now, as the fire and candlelight revealed them completely, I was more than ever amazed at Heathcliff's transformation."
"He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.","He had grown into a tall, athletic, and well-built man; next to him, my master appeared slim and youthful. His upright posture suggested he had served in the army. His expression and determination suggested a much older man than Mr. Linton; he seemed intelligent and showed no signs of past degradation."
"A half- civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for grace. My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak. 'Sit down, sir,' he said, at length. 'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything occurs to please her.' 'And I also,' answered Heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which I have a part.","A semi-civilized savagery still lurked in his lowered brows and his eyes, which filled with black fire, but it was controlled; and his bearing was even dignified: free from any coarseness, though stern and graceful. My master's surprise was as great as, or even greater than, my own: for a moment he was at a loss as to how to address the ""ploughboy,"" as he had called him. Heathcliff lowered his slender hand and regarded him coolly until he finally decided to speak. ""Sit down, sir,"" he said finally. ""Mrs. Linton remembers the past and would like me to give you a warm welcome; and of course, I am glad when anything gives her pleasure."" ""And so am I,"" replied Heathcliff, ""especially if it is something that has happened to me."""
"I shall stay an hour or two willingly.' He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.","""I'd be happy to stay an hour or two."" He sat opposite Catherine, who stared at him as if afraid he might disappear if she took him. He didn't often raise his eyes to her: a quick glance now and then was enough, but he reminded her with growing certainty of the undisguised joy he took in her. They were too absorbed in their shared joy to be embarrassed."
"Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug, seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself. 'I shall think it a dream to-morrow!' she cried. 'I shall not be able to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more. And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of me!' 'A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured. 'I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this plan - just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself.","Not so Mr. Edgar: he turned pale with anger, an emotion that reached its climax when His Ladyship rose, strode across the carpet, took Heathcliff's hands again, and burst into laughter. ""Tomorrow I shall think it was a dream!"" she cried. ""I shall not believe that I saw you again, touched you, and spoke to you. And yet, cruel Heathcliff! You do not deserve this reception. Three years of absence and silence, and no thought of me!"" ""A little more than you expected,"" he murmured. ""I heard of your wedding not so long ago, Cathy, and while I waited down in the courtyard, I was thinking of this plan: only to see your face again, perhaps a look of surprise and feigned amusement; and then to settle my score with Hindley; and finally, to escape justice by executing myself."""
"Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you'll not drive me off again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause. I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!' 'Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,' interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of politeness. 'Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever he may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.' She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.","Your welcome has driven these thoughts from my mind; but beware, next time you meet me with a different attitude! No, you will not drive me away again. You really felt sorry for me, did you not? Well, there was reason to be. I have lived a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I have only fought for you! ""Catherine, if we will not have cold tea, come to table,"" interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his usual tone and due courtesy. ""Mr. Heathcliff will have a long way to go, wherever he is staying tonight; and I am thirsty."" She took her place before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having set up her chairs, I left the room."
"The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely swallowed a mouthful.","The meal lasted barely ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never refilled, so she couldn't eat or drink. Edgar had made a small hole in his saucer and could barely take a bite."
"Their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he went to Gimmerton? 'No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: 'Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I called this morning.' Mr. Earnshaw invited HIM! and HE called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away.","Their guest stayed no more than an hour that evening. As we left, I asked him if he had been to Gimmerton. ""No, to Wuthering Heights,"" he replied. ""Mr. Earnshaw invited me when I called this morning."" Mr. Earnshaw invited him! And he invited Mr. Earnshaw! I had to think about that sentence after he left. Had he become a hypocrite, coming to the country to make trouble under false pretenses? I asked myself: deep down, I felt he would have been better off staying away."
"About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me. 'I cannot rest, Ellen,' she said, by way of apology. 'And I want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky, because I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.' 'What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?' I answered. 'As lads they had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised: it's human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between them.' 'But does it not show great weakness?' pursued she. 'I'm not envious: I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family exhibit for her.","Around midnight, Mrs. Linton woke me from my first nap. She crept into my room, sat on my bed, and pulled me awake by my hair. ""I can't sleep, Ellen,"" she said apologetically. ""And I need a living being to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is grumpy because I'm happy about something that doesn't interest him: he refuses to open his mouth except for surly, senseless chatter; and he acted as if I were cruel and selfish for wanting to talk while he was so sick and tired. He's always sick at the slightest thing! I complimented Heathcliff, and he began to cry, either from a headache or from jealousy. So I got up and left him alone."" ""What's the use of congratulating Heathcliff?"" I replied. ""As children, they hated each other, and Heathcliff would have been just as disgusted to hear them praised: it's human nature. Leave Mr. Linton alone unless you want an open quarrel between them."" ""But isn't that a sign of great weakness?"" she continued. ""I am not jealous: the luster of Isabella's fair hair and white skin, her graceful elegance, and the affection the whole family shows her, never hurt me."""
"Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same.' 'You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' said I. 'They humour you: I know what there would be to do if they did not.","Even you, Nelly, when we quarrel, Isabella is happy to support you; and I confess that, like a foolish mother, I call her 'darling' and flatter her humorously. Her brother is pleased that we get along well, and that pleases me. But they are very alike: they are spoiled children and think the world was made for them; and although I am kind to both of them, I believe a good chastisement might reform them. 'You are mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' I said. 'They are kind to you; I know what would happen if they were not.'"
"You can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.' 'And then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nelly?' she returned, laughing. 'No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.' I advised her to value him the more for his affection. 'I do,' she answered, 'but he needn't resort to whining for trifles. It is childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it for me, and been delighted from sympathy.","You can certainly afford to indulge their whims, as long as it is their duty to attend to your every wish. However, it may happen that you quarrel over a matter of equal importance to both sides; and then those who call you weak may well be as stubborn as you. ""And then we shall fight to the death, shall we not, Nelly?"" she answered, laughing. ""No! I tell you, I have such confidence in Linton's love that I believe I could kill him and he would not take revenge."" I advised her to appreciate him all the more for his affection. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""but he needn't be ashamed of trifles."" That is childish, and instead of bursting into tears because I told him that Heathcliff now deserved everyone's esteem and it would be an honor for the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he should have said it for me and been filled with compassion."
"He must get accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!' 'What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?' I inquired. 'He is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!' 'He explained it,' she replied. 'I wonder as much as you. He said he called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living; and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he consented.","He must get used to him, and he likes him only too well. Considering that Heathcliff has reason to oppose him, I am sure he has behaved admirably! ""What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?"" I asked. ""He is evidently reformed in every way: a true Christian. He turns to his enemies everywhere!"" ""He has explained it,"" she replied. ""I am as surprised as you are. He said he came to your house to inquire about me, supposing you still lived there. And Joseph told this to Hindley, who came out and questioned him about what he had been doing and how he lived. And finally, he invited him in. There were some people there playing cards. Heathcliff joined them. My brother lost money with him, and when he saw that he was well provided for, he invited him to come back in the evening, which he accepted."
"Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to instal himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.' 'It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said I. 'Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?' 'None for my friend,' she replied: 'his strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm.","Hindley is too hasty to choose his acquaintances carefully: he does not take the trouble to consider the reasons that might lead him to distrust one whom he has grievously offended. Yet Heathcliff says the chief reason for renewing his acquaintance with his old persecutor is the desire to settle in lodgings within a few steps of the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; also the hope of seeing him more often than if he were residing at Gimmerton. He intends to offer generous compensation for permission to remain at the Heights; and my brother's avarice will doubtless induce him to accept the conditions: he has always been avaricious; even when he seizes with one hand, he throws away with the other. ""It is a fine place for a young man!"" I said. ""Aren't you afraid of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?"" ""Not for my friend,"" she replied. ""His strong mind will protect him from danger. A little for Hindley. But he can't become morally worse than he is. And I stand between him and physical harm."""
"The event of this evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion against Providence. Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I.","Today's event has reconciled me with God and humanity! I had rebelled against Providence. Oh, I have endured very, very bitter suffering, Nelly! If this creature knew how bitter she is, she would be ashamed to mar her salvation with unnecessary ill-humor. Out of kindness to him, I endured it alone: Had I expressed my often-felt pain, he would have longed for relief as much as I did."
"However, it's over, and I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not only turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly. Good- night! I'm an angel!' In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine. Heathcliff - Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future - used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion.","But it's over, and I won't take revenge for her folly; I can afford anything in the future! If the meanest creature in the world slapped me on the cheek, I would not only turn to the other, but also beg her forgiveness for the provocation; and as proof, I would immediately reconcile myself with Edgar. ""Good night! I am an angel!"" With this satisfied conviction, she left, and the success of her plan was evident the next day: Mr. Linton had not only lost his bad temper (though his temper still seemed tempered by Catherine's exuberant vivacity), but he dared not contradict her when she took Isabel to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with a summer so sweet and loving that the house was a paradise for days; master and servant enjoyed the eternal sunshine. Heathcliff—and from now on I shall call him Mr. Heathcliff—at first exercised his freedom to visit Thrushcross Grange cautiously, apparently wanting to gauge the extent to which the lord would tolerate his interference."
"Catherine, also, deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected. He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling. My master's uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.","Catherine, too, considered it advisable to temper her joy at his reception; and gradually he earned the right to be expected. He retained much of the reserve so characteristic of his youth, which helped to suppress unexpected outbursts of emotion. My master's anxiety subsided, and other circumstances temporarily dispelled it."
"His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference.","His renewed anger arose from the unexpected misfortune of Isabella Linton, who suddenly and irresistibly felt attracted to the tolerated guest. She was then a charming young woman of eighteen, childlike in manners, but with a lively mind, strong feelings, and a lively, albeit irritating, temperament. Her brother, who loved her dearly, was astonished at this fantastic predilection."
"Leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate designing.","Apart from the humiliation that came with a union with an unknown man, and the possibility that his fortune, in the absence of a male heir, might pass into the hands of such a man, he possessed the common sense to understand Heathcliff's nature: he knew that, despite his altered appearance, his spirit had remained unaltered and unchanged. And he feared that spirit, he hated it; he recoiled at the thought of entrusting Isabella to him. He would have recoiled even more had he known that his affection was spontaneous and given without reciprocation; for as soon as he learned of her existence, he had blamed Heathcliff for his well-conceived plan."
"We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.","We had all noticed for some time that Miss Linton was gloomy and serious. She was becoming irritable and annoying; she constantly annoyed Catherine and strained her patience, testing her patience to the limit. We partly excused her on the grounds of her poor health: her condition was visibly worsening."
"But one day, when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast, complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which made her unhappy. 'How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable assertion. 'You are surely losing your reason. When have I been hash, tell me?' 'Yesterday,' sobbed Isabella, 'and now!' 'Yesterday!' said her sister-in-law. 'On what occasion?' 'In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff?' 'And that's your notion of harshness?' said Catherine, laughing. 'It was no hint that your company was superfluous? We didn't care whether you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.' 'Oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew I liked to be there!' 'Is she sane?' asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. 'I'll repeat our conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for you.' 'I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'I wanted to be with - ' ""Well?' said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence. 'With him: and I won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up. 'You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but yourself!' 'You are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in surprise. 'But I'll not believe this idiotcy! It is impossible that you can covet the admiration of Heathcliff - that you consider him an agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?' 'No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl. 'I love him more than ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!' 'I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!' Catherine declared, emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. 'Nelly, help me to convince her of her madness.","But one day, when she was behaving strangely obstinately, refusing breakfast and complaining that the servants disobeyed her; that the housekeeper wouldn't let her in and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold because the doors had been left open and we had deliberately left out the parlor fire to annoy her, among a hundred other absurd accusations, Mrs. Linton insisted that she go to bed and, after scolding her, threatened to call the doctor. The mention of Kenneth made her immediately exclaim that he was perfectly healthy and that it was only Catherine's hardness of heart that made her unhappy. ""How can you say I'm hard, you little flattering rascal?"" cried the housekeeper, astonished at this unreasonable assertion. ""You're losing your mind. When did I lose it, tell me?"" ""Yesterday,"" sobbed Isabella, ""and now!"" ""Yesterday!"" said her sister-in-law. ""On what occasion?"" ""During our walk on the moor, you suggested I could lounge about as I pleased while you lounged about with Mr. Heathcliff?"" ""And that was your idea of harshness?"" said Catherine, laughing. ""Didn't that mean your company was unnecessary? We didn't care whether you stayed with us or not; I only thought Heathcliff's conversation wouldn't distract you."" ""Oh no,"" sobbed the young woman; ""you wished I were gone because you knew I liked being there!"" ""Is she of her mind?"" asked Mrs. Linton pleadingly. ""I will repeat our conversation word for word, Isabella; and you can tell me what charm it had for you."" ""I don't mind the conversation,"" she replied. ""I wish—"" ""Well?"" "" asked Catherine, hesitating to finish her sentence. ""With him: and I'm not always sent away!"" she continued angrily. ""You're a dog in a manger, Cathy, and you only want to be loved by yourself!"" ""You're a cheeky little monkey!"" cried Mrs. Linton in astonishment. ""But I don't believe this nonsense! It's impossible that you covet Heathcliff's admiration, that you find him sympathetic! I hope I misunderstood you, Isabella?"" ""No, not at all,"" said the girl, madly in love. ""I love him more than you ever loved Edgar, and he could love me if you let him!"" ""Then I wouldn't be you for the world!"" declared Catherine gravely, seeming to mean it. ""Nelly, help me convince her of her folly."""
"Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He's not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.","Tell him what Heathcliff is: a pristine creature, uncultivated, uncultured; a desolate desert of gorse and basalt. I would sooner set that little canary in the park one winter's day than advise you to give him your heart! It is your lamentable ignorance of his character, my child, and nothing else that makes you dream. Do not think that he conceals deep kindness and affection beneath a stern facade! He is no diamond in the rough, no pearl-digger: he is a wild, pitiless man, a wolf."
"I never say to him, ""Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;"" I say, ""Let them alone, because I should hate them to be wronged:"" and he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There's my picture: and I'm his friend - so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap.' Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation. 'For shame! for shame!' she repeated, angrily. 'You are worse than twenty foes, you poisonous friend!' 'Ah! you won't believe me, then?' said Catherine. 'You think I speak from wicked selfishness?' 'I'm certain you do,' retorted Isabella; 'and I shudder at you!' 'Good!' cried the other. 'Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.' 'And I must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room. 'All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.","I never say to him, ""Leave this or that enemy alone, for it would be cruel and mean to hurt him."" I say, ""Leave them alone, for I would not have them wronged."" And he would crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if you were a burden to him. I know he could not love a Linton; and yet he would most likely marry your fortune and your hopes: avarice grows in him like a stubborn sin. It is my image: and I am his friend, so much so that, if he had seriously thought of capturing you, I might have kept silent and let you fall into his trap. Miss Linton stared at her sister-in-law indignantly. ""Shame! Shame!"" she repeated angrily. ""You are worse than twenty enemies, you poisonous friend!"" ""Ah! You don't believe me?"" said Catherine. ""Do you think I speak from malicious selfishness?"" ""I know,"" Isabella replied, ""and I shudder for you!"" ""Bravo!"" cried the other. ""Try it yourself, if you will: I have done it, and I abandon the argument of your audacity."" ""And I must pay for her selfishness!"" she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room. ""Everything, everything is against me: she has spoiled my only consolation."""
"But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?' 'Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,' I said. 'He's a bird of bad omen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.","But she lied, didn't she? Mr. Heathcliff is no devil: he has an honorable and upright soul, or he would remember her. ""Put him out of your thoughts, miss,"" I said. ""He is a sinister bird: no partner for you."" Mrs. Linton spoke sharply, and yet I cannot contradict her. She knows his heart better than I or anyone else; and she would never present him in a worse light."
"Honest people don't hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came. They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago - it was Joseph who told me - I met him at Gimmerton: ""Nelly,"" he said, ""we's hae a crowner's 'quest enow, at ahr folks'.","Honest people don't hide their deeds. How did he live? How did he become rich? Why does he live in Wuthering Heights, the house of a man he despises? It's said that Mr. Earnshaw's health has deteriorated since his arrival.

""Nelly,"" he said, ""you've got plenty of time to visit the Crown Jewelers, folks."""

He's the master, yes, that's right, who goes so far as to attack the greats. He's not afraid of the judges, not Paul, not Peter, not John, not Matthew, not them, is he? He loves it—he wants his cheeky face to look like theirs! And that nice boy, Heathcliff, mind you, he's rare."
"He can girn a laugh as well 's onybody at a raight divil's jest. Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t' Grange?

I' course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur's goold runs into his pocket, and her fathur's son gallops down t' broad road, while he flees afore to oppen t' pikes!"" Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff's conduct be true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?' 'You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!' she replied. 'I'll not listen to your slanders.","He laughs as well as anyone at a joke about a real devil. Doesn't he tell us of his good life among us when he goes to the manor? Here's how it is: rising at sunset: dice, brandy, closed shutters, and candles until noon the next day: then the gangs betray and curse his comrade, which shames honest people; what can this farmer do, what can he earn for himself, if he doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, and goes to the neighbor's to gossip with his wife? Of course, he tells Lady Catherine how his father's gold disappears into his pocket, and how his father's son gallops down the high road while he himself runs to open the pikes! Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rogue, but no liar; and if his story of Heathcliff's behavior is true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you? ""You're in cahoots with the others, Ellen!"" she answered. “I will not listen to your slander.”"
"What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!' Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her.","How wicked you must be to attempt to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!’ I cannot say whether she would have been able to overcome this madness, had she been left to herself, or whether she would have persisted in it: she had little time for reflection. The next day there was a session of law in the neighboring town; my master was to be present, and Mr. Heathcliff, conscious of his absence, arrived a little earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were in the library, in a hostile mood, but silent: the latter was disturbed by her recent indiscretion, and the exposure of her secret feelings in a brief fit of rage; the former, on mature reflection, was sincerely offended by her companion; and if she again laughed at her insolence, she was disposed to forbid her from laughing."
"She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips. Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done had it been practicable. 'Come in, that's right!' exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair to the fire. 'Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.","She laughed when she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the fireplace and saw a mischievous smile on his lips. Isabella, lost in thought or a book, stayed until the door opened; it was too late for an escape attempt, which she would have gladly made if it had been possible. ""Come in, it doesn't matter!"" cried the hostess cheerfully, pulling a chair up to the fire. ""Here are two people who desperately need a third person to melt the ice between them; and you are the one we should choose."""
"Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it's not Nelly; don't look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.","Heathcliff, I'm proud to finally show you someone who loves you more than I do. I hope you're flattered. No, it's not Nelly; don't look at her! My poor sister-in-law's heart breaks at the mere sight of your physical and moral beauty."
"It lies in your own power to be Edgar's brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha'n't run off,' she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. 'We were quarrelling like cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal oblivion!' 'Catherine!' said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her, 'I'd thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.' As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor. 'By no means!' cried Mrs. Linton in answer. 'I won't be named a dog in the manger again. You SHALL stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don't you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I'm sure she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.' 'I think you belie her,' said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face them. 'She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!' And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.","""You have the power to be Edgar's brother! No, no, Isabella, you must not run away,"" she continued, mocking the bewildered girl who had risen indignantly and with feigned gaiety. ""We have fought over you, Heathcliff, like cats; I have been defeated in my protestations of devotion and admiration. Moreover, I am told that if I had only the courtesy to withdraw, my rival would, at her pleasure, shoot an arrow through your soul that would bind you forever and consign my image to eternal oblivion!"" ""Catherine!"" said Isabella, filled with dignity and refusing to free herself from the grip that held her, ""I would be grateful if you would stick to the truth and not slander me, even in jest!"" ""Mr. Heathcliff, be so kind as to ask your friend to release me. She forgets that we are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her pains me indescribably."" Since the guest made no reply, but sat down and seemed completely indifferent to her feelings for him, she turned and murmured a sincere plea for freedom to her tormentor. ""No way!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""I will no longer be called a dog in a manger. You MUST stay: immediately! Heathcliff, why don't you show yourself satisfied with my good news? Isabella swears that Edgar's love for me is nothing compared to her love for you. I'm sure she's made a speech like this before, hasn't she, Ellen? And she's been fasting since the walk the day before yesterday, out of grief and anger that I kept her from you because I deemed her unacceptable."" ""I think you're lying to her,"" said Heathcliff, turning his chair toward them. ""In any case, she's now leaving my company!"" And he stared intently at the subject of conversation, as one might stare at a strange and repulsive creature: an Indian centipede, for example, which one studies out of curiosity despite the dislike it arouses."
"The poor thing couldn't bear that; she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of red. 'There's a tigress!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain. 'Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to him. Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do execution - you must beware of your eyes.' 'I'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. 'But what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the truth, were you?' 'I assure you I was,' she returned. 'She has been dying for your sake several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don't notice it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that's all.","The poor creature could not bear this; she quickly turned white and red, and with tears in her eyelashes stretched out her little fingers to free Catherine's grip. No sooner had she released one finger from her arm than another closed, impossible to withdraw entirely. Then she began to use her claws; their sharpness soon adorned those of the prisoner with crescent-shaped talons. ""There's a tigress!"" cried Mrs. Linton, releasing her and squeezing her hand painfully. ""Go away, for goodness' sake, and hide your pretty face! What madness to show him those claws! Can't you imagine what conclusions he will draw? Look, Heathcliff! They are instruments of execution; watch your eyes."" ""I would tear them from her fingers if they threatened me,"" he replied harshly, as the door closed behind her. ""But what did you mean by teasing that animal like that, Cathy? You weren't telling the truth, were you?"" ""I assured you,"" she replied. ""She's been pining over you for weeks, and this morning she went completely berserk, hurling insults at you because I pointed out your faults so clearly, in an attempt to dampen her admiration. But don't you see: I wanted to punish her insolence, that's all."""
"I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.' 'And I like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a very ghoulish fashion. You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they detestably resemble Linton's.' 'Delectably!' observed Catherine. 'They are dove's eyes - angel's!' 'She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence. 'I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion. 'Half a dozen nephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's goods; remember THIS neighbour's goods are mine.' 'If they were MINE, they would be none the less that,' said Heathcliff; 'but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.' From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of the evening.","I love her too much, my dear Heathcliff, to allow you to possess her and devour her whole. 'And I love her too much to try,' he said, 'except in a very uncanny way. You would hear strange things if I lived alone with that sentimental, waxen face. The most common thing would be to paint it every day or two in the colors of the rainbow, and blacken the blue eyes. They make Linton's eyes look terrible.' 'Beautiful!' remarked Catherine. 'They are dove-like eyes, angel-like eyes!' 'She is her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a pause. 'I should be sorry,' replied his companion. ""Half a dozen nephews would extinguish her title, God willing! Now let your thoughts wander: you are too much inclined to covet your neighbor's goods. Remember, that neighbor's goods are mine."" ""If they were mine, they would be no less mine,"" said Heathcliff. ""But Isabella Linton may be an idiot, but she is certainly not mad. In short, we let the matter rest, as you advise me."" From their words, they let the matter rest; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts, too. The other, I felt sure, remembered this often during the evening."
"I saw him smile to himself - grin rather - and lapse into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment. I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the master's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she - she could not be called OPPOSITE, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings.","I saw him smiling inwardly—or rather, grimacing—and sinking into disturbing reveries whenever Mrs. Linton was out of the room. I resolved to observe his every move. My heart was always decidedly on the side of the gentleman and not Catherine's: rightly so, I supposed, for he was kind, trusting, and honorable; and she—one could hardly say she was the opposite, yet she seemed to allow herself such license that I had little confidence in her principles and even less understanding of her feelings."
"I wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.","I wished something would happen that would free Wuthering Heights and the barn from Mr. Heathcliff and leave us as we were before his arrival. His visits were a constant nightmare for me; and, I suspected, for my master as well. His stay at Wuthering Heights was an incredible burden."
"I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy. SOMETIMES, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm. I've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.","I felt as if God had left the stray sheep to wander on its own, and that a wild beast was lurking among the sheep and the flock, just waiting for the moment to attack and destroy them. Sometimes, when I was alone thinking about these things, I would suddenly jump up in fear, put on my hat, and go and see what was going on at the farm. I would convince myself it was my duty to warn him about people's comments about his behavior; then I would remember his persistent bad habits, and, hoping to help him, I would not enter that dreary house, doubting that I could bear to be taken at his word."
"One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W.","One day, while making a detour to Gimmerton, I passed the old gate. This is roughly where my story unfolded: a clear, icy afternoon; the ground was bare and the road hard and dry. I came to a rock where the road turns left toward the moor; a rough pillar of sand bearing the letter W."
"H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.","H. to the north, G. to the east, and T. G. to the southwest. It serves as a guide to the Grange, the Heights, and the village."
"The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. 'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily.","The sun cast a yellowish tinge on its gray head and reminded me of summer. I can't say why, but suddenly a wave of childhood washed over me. Hindley and I had made it our favorite spot twenty years ago. I stared at the weathered block for a long time; then I bent down and saw a hole at the bottom, still full of snail shells and pebbles, which we liked to store there with other perishable foods. And as fresh as reality, it seemed to me as if I were seeing my old playmate again sitting on the parched lawn: his dark, angular head bent forward, his small hand poking a piece of slate in the earth. ""Poor Hindley!"" I cried involuntarily."
"I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought - or should die soon! - supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate.","I shuddered: my physical eye was deceived for a moment, for I thought the child had raised its face and was staring straight into my eyes! It had disappeared in an instant; but I immediately felt an irresistible desire to reach the hill. Superstition urged me to yield to this impulse: Let's imagine he's dead! I thought—or he would die soon!—Let's imagine this is a sign of death! The closer I got to the house, the more agitated I became; and at the sight of him, I trembled all over. The apparition had caught up with me: he was looking through the gate."
"That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, MY Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since. 'God bless thee, darling!' I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears. 'Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.' He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint. 'I am come to see thy father, Hareton,' I added, guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised as one with me. He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity.","That was my first thought when I saw a boy with brown, elfin eyes pressing his rosy face against the bars. After much consideration, I realized it must be Hareton, MY Hareton, who had changed little since I had left him ten months earlier. ""God bless you, my darling!"" I cried, instantly forgetting my foolish fears. ""Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, your nurse."" He stepped back and picked up a large flint. ""I've come to see your father, Hareton,"" I added, concluding from the gesture that Nelly, if she still lived in his memory, was not one with me. He raised his missile to throw it; I began a soothing speech, but could not stop his hand: the flint struck my hat; then a series of curses escaped the stammering man, which, whether he understood them or not, were uttered with controlled emphasis and distorted his childlike face into an expression of surprise and malice."
"You may be certain this grieved more than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him.","Don't worry, that made me more sad than angry. I could barely cry, so I took an orange out of my pocket and offered it to him to calm him down. He hesitated for a moment, then snatched it from my hand, as if he thought I was just trying to seduce and disappoint him."
"I showed another, keeping it out of his reach. 'Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?' I inquired. 'The curate?' 'Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,' he replied. 'Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,' said I. 'Who's your master?' 'Devil daddy,' was his answer. 'And what do you learn from daddy?' I continued. He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. 'What does he teach you?' I asked. 'Naught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at him.' 'Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?' I observed. 'Ay - nay,' he drawled. 'Who, then?' 'Heathcliff.' 'I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.' 'Ay!' he answered again.","I held up another and held it out of his reach. ""Who taught you those fine words, my dear?"" I asked. ""The priest?"" ""Goodness me, the priest and you! Give me this,"" he replied. ""Tell us where you learned your lessons, and you'll understand,"" I said. ""Who is your teacher?"" ""Wicked Papa,"" he replied. ""And what do you learn from Papa?"" I continued. He pounced on the fruit; I lifted it higher. ""What does he teach you?"" I asked. ""Nothing,"" he said, ""except to stay out of his way. Papa can't stand me because I scold him."" ""Ah! And the devil teaches you to scold Papa?"" I remarked. ""Yes... no,"" he drawled. ""Who then?"" ""Heathcliff."" ""I asked him if he liked Mr. Heathcliff."" ""Yes!"" he replied."
"Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the sentences - 'I known't: he pays dad back what he gies to me - he curses daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.' 'And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?' I pursued. 'No, I was told the curate should have his - teeth dashed down his - throat, if he stepped over the threshold Heathcliff had promised that!' I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.","To understand why he loved her, I could only formulate the following sentences: ""I know: he gives back to Papa what he gives me; he curses Papa because he curses me. He tells me to do what I want."" ""And the priest doesn't teach you to read and write?"" I continued. ""No, I'm told the priest will have his teeth cut if he crosses the threshold promised by Heathcliff!"" I pressed the orange into his hand and told him to tell his father that a woman named Nelly Dean was waiting for him at the garden gate to speak to him. He went up the path and into the house; but instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the doorstep; I turned immediately and ran down the road as fast as I could. Only at the signpost did I stop, as frightened as if I had raised a gnome."
"This is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to cheek the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure. The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort.","This had little to do with Miss Isabella's affair, but it prompted me to remain vigilant and do everything I could to prevent the spread of such an evil influence at the Grange, even if it meant causing a domestic uproar by interrupting Mrs. Linton's festivities. The next time Heathcliff came by, my young wife was feeding pigeons in the yard. She hadn't spoken to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had also stopped complaining, which was a great consolation."
"Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight.","I knew Heathcliff wasn't overly polite to Miss Linton. As soon as he saw her, the first thing he did was thoroughly inspect the front door. I stood at the kitchen window, but withdrew so as not to be seen."
"He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her. 'Judas! Traitor!' I ejaculated. 'You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A deliberate deceiver.' 'Who is, Nelly?' said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance. 'Your worthless friend!' I answered, warmly: 'the sneaking rascal yonder.","Then he crossed the sidewalk and said something. She seemed shy and about to leave. To stop her, he put his hand on her arm. She turned her face away. Obviously, he was asking her a question she didn't want to answer. Another quick glance toward the house followed, and, thinking he wouldn't be seen, the villain had the audacity to embrace her. ""Judas! Traitor!"" I exclaimed. ""Aren't you also a hypocrite? A deliberate imposter."" ""Who's there, Nelly?"" Catherine's voice asked beside me. I was too engrossed in the couple outside to notice their entrance. ""Your good-for-nothing friend!"" I replied warmly. ""That skulking villain over there."""
"Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us he is coming in! I wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when he told you he hated her?' Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn't withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue. 'To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!' she cried. 'You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone! - I beg you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!' 'God forbid that he should try!' answered the black villain. I detested him just then. 'God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder after sending him to heaven!' 'Hush!' said Catherine, shutting the inner door! 'Don't vex me.","Ah, he's seen us, he's coming in! I wonder if he'll have the heart to find a plausible excuse for sleeping with Miss, when he said he hated her."" Mrs. Linton suddenly saw Isabella running into the garden; a minute later, Heathcliff opened the door. I could not suppress my indignation; but Catherine furiously demanded silence and threatened to send me out of the kitchen if I dared to reveal my insolence. ""If they hear you, you might be taken for the mistress!"" she cried. ""Take your place! Heathcliff, what are you going to do, making such a fuss? I told you to leave Isabella alone! Pray, unless you are tired of being received here and want Linton to shoot you in the face!"" ""God forbid!"" answered the black villain. I hated him at that moment. ""My God, keep him gentle and patient! I've been getting angrier ever since I sent him to heaven!"" ""Shh!"" said Catherine, closing the inner door! ""Don't make me angry."""
"Why have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?' 'What is it to you?' he growled. 'I have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not YOUR husband: YOU needn't be jealous of me!' 'I'm not jealous of you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you. Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry her.","Why did you ignore my request? Did she deliberately pressure you? ""What's it to you?"" he growled. ""I have the right to kiss her if she wishes, and you have no right to oppose it. I am not your husband: you have no right to be jealous of me!"" ""I am not jealous of you,"" replied the mistress. ""I am jealous of you. Wash your face: you have no right to look at me angrily! If you love Isabella, you must marry her."""
"But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff! There, you won't answer. I'm certain you don't.' 'And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' I inquired. 'Mr. Linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively. 'He might spare himself the trouble,' said Heathcliff: 'I could do as well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words now, while we are at it.","But do you love him? Tell the truth, Heathcliff! You won't answer, will you? I'm sure of it. ""And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying this man?"" I asked. ""Mr. Linton would approve,"" Madame replied firmly. ""Spare him the trouble,"" said Heathcliff. ""I could just as well do without his consent. And as for you, Catherine, while we're at it, I have a few words to say."""
"I want you to be aware that I KNOW you have treated me infernally - infernally! Do you hear? And if you flatter yourself that I don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law's secret: I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you aside!' 'What new phase of his character is this?' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement. 'I've treated you infernally and you'll take your revenge! How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you infernally?' 'I seek no revenge on you,' replied Heathcliff, less vehemently. 'That's not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him; they crush those beneath them.","I want you to know that I know you have treated me like hell—like hell! Do you hear me? And if you imagine I don't notice it, you are a fool; and if you think I will be consoled with gentle words, you are an idiot; and if you think I will suffer without avenging myself, I shall soon convince you of the contrary! In the meantime, thank you for letting me in on your sister-in-law's secret: I swear I will make the best of it. And leave you alone! ""What a new turn in her character!"" cried Mrs. Linton in astonishment. ""I have treated you like hell, and you are avenging yourself! How can you do it, you ungrateful animal? How have I treated you like hell?"" ""I don't mean to be avenged upon you,"" replied Heathcliff less violently. ""That is not my intention."" The tyrant oppresses his slaves, and they do not turn against him; they oppress those under their command."
"You are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able. Having levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!' 'Oh, the evil is that I am NOT jealous, is it?' cried Catherine. 'Well, I won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul.","You can torture me to death for your own amusement, but let me have a little fun just the same, and refrain from insulting you if possible. Now that I've destroyed my palace, don't build yourself a hut and smugly boast of your charity in giving me one. If I imagined you really wanted me to marry Isabel, I'd slit my throat! ""Oh, the worst of it is: I'm not jealous, am I?"" cried Catherine. ""Well, I won't repeat my marriage proposal: that's as bad as offering a lost soul to Satan."""
"Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.","Your happiness, like his, lies in sowing misfortune. You prove it. Edgar has recovered from the anger he felt at your arrival; I am beginning to feel safe and peaceful; and you, who do not want us to live in peace, seem determined to quarrel."
"Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.' The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it.","Quarrel with Edgar, I beg you, Heathcliff, and betray his sister. You will find the most effective way to repay me. The conversation broke off. Mrs. Linton sat red and sullen by the fire. The spirit that served her was out of control: she could neither restrain nor control it."
"He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long. 'Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?' 'Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' I answered. 'She's sadly put out by Mr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange his visits on another footing. There's harm in being too soft, and now it's come to this - .' And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest.","He stood with folded arms before the fire, brooding over his gloomy thoughts. In this attitude I left them to seek the gentleman, who was wondering what had detained Catherine so long below. ""Ellen,"" he said, as I entered, ""have you seen your mistress?"" ""Yes, she is in the kitchen, sir,"" I answered. ""She is very much annoyed with Mr. Heathcliff's conduct, and I think it is time she changed her ways. It is dangerous to be too indulgent, and now it has come to this—"" And I described the scene in court, and, as best I dared, the whole quarrel that ensued. I supposed it would not do Mrs. Linton much harm; unless she did so herself later by taking up the defense of her guest."
"Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame. 'This is insufferable!' he exclaimed. 'It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian - I have humoured her enough.' He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me, to the kitchen.","Edgar Linton could hardly listen to me. His first words betrayed that he had not absolved his wife of all responsibility. ""It is intolerable!"" he cried. ""It is a scandal that she considers him a friend and forces his company on me! Call two men from the hall, Ellen. Catherine will not quarrel with that scoundrel any more—I have had enough of her."" He went downstairs, ordered the servants to wait in the hall, and, followed by me, went into the kitchen."
"Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation. 'How is this?' said Linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!' 'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?' asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him.","The inhabitants of the house had resumed their heated argument: Mrs. Linton, at least, was cursing with renewed vigor; Heathcliff had gone to the window and hung his head, evidently somewhat intimidated by her harsh criticism. He first noticed the master of the house and made a sign to her to be quiet; she obeyed abruptly when she learned the reason for his insinuations. ""How?"" Linton asked her. ""What decency have you to stay here, after the language this villain uses with you? I suppose you pay no attention to him, for it is his usual language: you are accustomed to his baseness, and perhaps you think I could get used to it too!"" ""Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?"" asked the mistress of the house, in a tone intended to provoke her husband, and which expressed both indifference and contempt for his anger. Heathcliff, who had opened his eyes at the first words, laughed mockingly at the last, apparently deliberately to attract Mr. Linton's attention."
"He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion. 'I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I acquiesced - foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure. Three minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.","He succeeded, but Edgar had no intention of entertaining him with unbridled passion. ""I have been patient with you so far, sir,"" he said calmly. ""Not that I am unaware of your wretched and depraved character, but I felt you were only partly responsible. And since Catherine wished to maintain contact with you, I—foolishly—agreed. Your presence is a moral poison that would infect even the most virtuous. For this reason, and to avoid worse, I deny you immediate access to this house and hereby notify you that I demand your immediate departure. Three minutes' delay makes this departure involuntary and shameful."""
"Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision. 'Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!' he said. 'It is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton, I'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!' My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it. 'Fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry surprise. 'If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to be beaten.","Heathcliff regarded the speaker with a mocking expression. ""Cathy, your little lamb is as dangerous as a bull!"" he said. ""He's threatening to split his head on my fingers. My goodness! Mr. Linton, I'm terribly sorry you're not worth shooting!"" My master looked down the corridor and signaled to me to fetch the men; he didn't want to risk a personal confrontation. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed me; and as I was about to call her, she pulled me back, slammed the door, and locked it. ""Good intentions!"" she said, in response to her husband's angry and surprised look. ""If you don't have the courage to attack him, excuse yourself, or you'll get a beating."""
"It will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess. No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it! I'm delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant indulgence of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me!' It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.","Thus, you appear no braver than you are. No, I will swallow the key before you receive it! I am richly rewarded for my kindness to all! After constantly yielding to the weakness of one and the malice of another, I deserve in return two examples of blind ingratitude, stupid to the point of absurdity! Edgar, I have defended you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff would whip you to death for daring to entertain an evil thought against me! He needed no whip to produce this effect on the master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's hand, and as a precaution, she threw it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar trembled nervously, and his face turned deathly pale."
"For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face. 'Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton. 'We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice. Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt! Your type is not a lamb, it's a sucking leveret.' 'I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!' said her friend. 'I compliment you on your taste.","He couldn't shake the feelings: a mixture of fear and humiliation completely overwhelmed him. He leaned back in a chair and covered his face. ""Oh dear! You should have been knighted for this once!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""We're beaten! We're beaten! Heathcliff would attack you as soon as the king would send his army against a colony of mice. Chin up! You'll be fine! You're not a lamb, but a young suckling bunny."" ""I wish you luck with that puny, milk-blooded creature, Cathy!"" said her friend. ""I congratulate you on your taste."""
"And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?' The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push. He'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man.","And that's the slobbering, trembling thing you preferred to me! I wouldn't strike him with my fist, but I would kick him and give him great satisfaction. ""Is he crying or fainting with fear?"" The fellow came forward and pushed aside the chair Linton was sitting on. He should have kept his distance: My master jumped up quickly and struck him right in the throat—a blow that would have brought down a lighter man."
"It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front entrance. 'There! you've done with coming here,' cried Catherine. 'Get away, now; he'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he did overhear us, of course he'd never forgive you. You've played me an ill turn, Heathcliff! But go - make haste! I'd rather see Edgar at bay than you.' 'Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?' he thundered. 'By hell, no! I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut before I cross the threshold! If I don't floor him now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!' 'He is not coming,' I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. 'There's the coachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.' The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with them.","He was briefly out of breath; and while he was gasping for breath, Mr. Linton went through the back door into the garden and from there to the front entrance. ""Why? You weren't here at all!"" cried Catherine. ""Go away now! He's coming back with a pair of pistols and half a dozen servants. If he heard us, he'll never forgive you, of course. You've wronged me, Heathcliff! But go, hurry! I'd rather see Edgar from afar than you."" ""Do you think I'll go away with this burning blow in my throat?"" he thundered. ""For heaven's sake, no! I'll crush his ribs like a rotten nut before I cross the threshold! If I don't lay him down now, I'll kill him one day; so, since you value his existence, let me get him!"" ""He won't come,"" I interrupted, inventing a lie. ""Here are the coachman and the two gardeners; you will certainly not be eager to be forced into the street by them! Each has a cudgel; and the master will no doubt be watching from the parlor window to see whether they obey his orders."" The gardeners and the coachman were there, but Linton was among them."
"They had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in. Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up- stairs.","They had already entered the courtyard. After careful consideration, Heathcliff decided to avoid a fight with three subordinates: He grabbed the poker, broke the lock on the inner door, and fled as they stumbled inside. Mrs. Linton, very agitated, asked me to accompany her upstairs."
"She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance. 'I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!' she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa. 'A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I'm in danger of being seriously ill. I wish it may prove true.","She didn't know I had contributed to the uproar, and I was determined to keep her guessing. ""I'm almost mad, Nelly!"" she cried, throwing herself onto the sofa. ""A thousand hammer blows are hitting me on the head! Tell Isabella to stay away from me; this noise is her fault; and if she or anyone else increases my anger now, I'll be furious. And, Nelly, tell Edgar, when you see him again tonight, that I'm likely to become seriously ill. I hope it's true."""
"He has startled and distressed me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him to turn listener? Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.","He has given me a good fright and upset me! I want to frighten him. Besides, he could easily launch into a series of insults and complaints; I'm sure I'd have to accuse him, and God knows where that would end! Will you do that, my dear Nelly? You know I am absolutely innocent in this matter. What made him listen to me? Heathcliff's speech caused a scandal after your departure; but I could have quickly gotten him away from Isabella, and the rest would have been meaningless."
"Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend - if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity! But it's a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it.","Now everything collapses; through the madness of hearing one's own wickedness, which haunts some like a demon! If Edgar had never heard our conversation, he would have been no worse off. Frankly, when he cried out in that tone of unreasoning displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff so fiercely that my voice grew hoarse, I didn't care what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene ended, we would all be torn apart for who knows how long! Well, if I can't keep Heathcliff as a friend—if Edgar is wicked and jealous—I'll try to break their hearts by breaking mine. That would be a quick way to end everything when I'm at my limit! But that's the sort of thing to reserve for desperate hopes; I wouldn't surprise Linton with it."
"To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.' The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish to 'frighten' her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.","So far, he has been reserved in his fear of provoking me; you must make him understand the danger of deviating from this policy and remind him of my passionate temper, which, when aflame, borders on fury. I wish you could banish this apathy from this face and regard me with a little more sympathy. The stoic attitude with which I received these instructions was undoubtedly frustrating enough: for they were given in all sincerity; but I believed that one who can anticipate her changes of mood can, even under her influence, maintain a certain degree of self-control through willpower; and I did not want to ""frighten"" her husband, as she put it, or aggravate his problems for the benefit of his selfishness. Therefore, when I met the gentleman in the parlor, I said nothing; but I allowed myself to return to listen in case their quarrel flared up again."
"He began to speak first. 'Remain where you are, Catherine,' he said; without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. 'I shall not stay. I am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn whether, after this evening's events, you intend to continue your intimacy with - ' 'Oh, for mercy's sake,' interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, 'for mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice- water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.' 'To get rid of me, answer my question,' persevered Mr. Linton. 'You must answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.","He spoke first. ""Stay where you are, Catherine,"" he said, not angrily, but with a touch of despair and sadness. ""I will not stay. I have not come to quarrel or to reconcile; I only wish to know if, after the events of this evening, you wish to continue your intimacy with…"" ""Oh, for goodness' sake,"" interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, ""for goodness' sake, let's speak of it no more! Your coolness cannot be turned into fever: your veins are full of icy water; but mine boil, and the sight of that cold makes them dance."" ""To get rid of me, answer my question,"" insisted Mr. Linton. ""You must answer it; and I do not mind this violence. I have found that you can be as stoic as anyone when you want to be."""
"Will you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you to be MY friend and HIS at the same time; and I absolutely REQUIRE to know which you choose.' 'I require to be let alone?' exclaimed Catherine, furiously. 'I demand it! Don't you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you - you leave me!' She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages! There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear. He told me to fetch some water.","Will you deny Heathcliff after all this, or will you deny me? It is impossible for you to be both MY friend and HIS; and I absolutely DEMAND to know for whom you choose. ""I demand to be left alone!"" cried Catherine angrily. ""I demand it! Can't you see I can hardly stand? Edgar, you—you're leaving me!"" She rang the bell until it broke with a sharp noise; I entered slowly. Such senseless, vicious outbursts of rage were a test of a saint's character! She lay beating her head against the back of the sofa, grinding her teeth as if they would break at any moment! Mr. Linton looked at her suddenly with an expression of regret and fear. He told me to fetch some water."
"She had no breath for speaking. I brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.","She couldn't breathe or speak. I brought her a full glass, and when she refused to drink, I splashed the water in her face. After a few seconds, she stretched stiffly and opened her eyes. Her cheeks, pale and deathly pale, looked dead."
"Linton looked terrified. 'There is nothing in the world the matter,' I whispered. I did not want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart. 'She has blood on her lips!' he said, shuddering. 'Never mind!' I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.","Linton looked scared. ""It's okay,"" I whispered. I didn't want him to give up, even though deep down I was scared. ""She has blood on her lips!"" he said, shuddering. ""Leave her alone!"" I snapped. And I told him how, before he arrived, she had decided to vent her anger in a fit of rage."
"I incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up - her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.","I told the story aloud and casually, and she heard me; for she flinched: her hair blew over her shoulders, her eyes flashed, the muscles of her neck and arms tensed unusually. I thought she had at least broken some bones; but she looked around briefly and then hurried from the room. The Lord commanded me to follow her, which I did, to the door of her room; she prevented me from going any further by locking it against me."
"As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask whether she would have some carried up. 'No!' she replied, peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's occupations.","Since she didn't offer to prepare breakfast the next morning, I asked her if she wanted something delivered. ""No!"" she answered firmly. The same question was repeated at dinner and snack time, and the next day, and the answer was the same. Mr. Linton spent his time in the library and didn't inquire about his wife's activities."
"Isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him. WHILE Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened - wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation - and SHE fasted pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's name, since he might not hear her voice.","He and Isabella conversed for an hour, during which he endeavored to inspire in her a just disgust at Heathcliff's advances; but understanding nothing of her evasive answers, he was compelled to end the interrogation unsatisfactorily; he added, however, a solemn warning: that if she were foolish enough to encourage this unworthy suitor, it would destroy all connection between her and him. While Miss Linton walked about the park and garden, always silent and almost always in tears; while her brother hid behind books which he never opened—weary, I supposed, with the constant and vague expectation that Catherine, repentant of her conduct, would come of her own accord to beg pardon and seek a reconciliation—and while she obstinately fasted, probably supposing that Edgar was suffocated by his absence at every meal, and only his pride prevented him from throwing himself at his feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange housed only one rational soul, and that this soul dwelt in my body. I did not fail to sympathize with Mademoiselle and reprimand my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who longed to hear his wife's name for fear of hearing her voice."
"I determined they should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first. Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast.","I decided to proceed as I thought best. And although it was an agonizingly slow process, I finally got a vague idea of its progress: just as I had first suspected. On the third day, Mrs. Linton opened her door, drank water from her pitcher and can, and asked for more and a bowl of porridge, for she thought she was dying. I wrote this down as an address to Edgar; I didn't believe it, so I kept it to myself and brought him tea and dry toast."
"She ate and drank eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning. 'Oh, I will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me. I wish I had not taken that.' Then a good while after I heard her murmur, 'No, I'll not die - he'd be glad - he does not love me at all - he would never miss me!' 'Did you want anything, ma'am?' I inquired, still preserving my external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated manner. 'What is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face. 'Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?' 'Neither,' replied I; 'if you mean Mr. Linton. He's tolerably well, I think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is continually among his books, since he has no other society.' I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder. 'Among his books!' she cried, confounded. 'And I dying! I on the brink of the grave! My God! does he know how I'm altered?' continued she, staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall. 'Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet - in play, perhaps.","She ate and drank greedily and sank back on her pillow with a groan, clenching her hands and fists. ""Oh, I shall die,"" she cried, ""for no one cares about me. I wish I hadn't."" Then, a long time later, I heard her murmur, ""No, I shall not die—he would be pleased—he doesn't love me at all—he would never miss me!"" ""Would you like something, madam?"" I asked, maintaining my apparent composure despite her hideous expression and strange, exaggerated behavior. ""What is this listless creature doing?"" she asked, pushing the thick, matted curls from her gaunt face. ""Has he become lethargic, or is he dead?"" ""Neither,"" I replied; ""if you mean Mr. Linton."" He's doing quite well, I think, although his studies keep him more occupied than necessary: he's constantly engrossed in his books because he has no company. I wouldn't have spoken like that if I'd known her true condition, but I couldn't shake the thought that she had a hand in his moodiness. ""In his books!"" she cried in astonishment. ""And I'm dying! I'm on the verge of the grave! Good heavens! Does he know how much I've changed?"" she continued, staring at her reflection on the opposite wall. ""Is it Catherine Linton? He imagines me as a pet—perhaps a playmate."""
"Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two: either to starve at once - that would be no punishment unless he had a heart - or to recover, and leave the country. Are you speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life?' 'Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.' 'You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?' she returned. 'Persuade him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!' 'No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good effects.' 'If I were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'I'd kill myself directly! These three awful nights I've never closed my lids - and oh, I've been tormented! I've been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy you don't like me.","Can't you tell him it's terribly serious? Nelly, if it's not too late, as soon as I know how he is, I'll choose between two options: either starve to death immediately—it would be no punishment if he had no heart—or get well and leave the country. Are you telling the truth about him? Be careful. Is he really so indifferent to my life? ""Well, madam,"" I answered, ""the master doesn't know you're mad; and of course he's not afraid you'll starve to death."" ""You don't think so? Can't you tell him I am?"" she retorted. ""Convince him! Speak with your own mind: say you're sure I am!"" ""No, you're forgetting, Mrs. Linton,"" I suggested, ""that you've eaten heartily tonight and will feel the benefits tomorrow."" ""If I were only sure it would kill him,"" she interrupted, ""I'd kill myself right there!"" I haven't slept a wink these three terrible nights—and oh, how it torments me! I'm obsessed, Nelly! But I'm beginning to believe you don't love me."
"How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people here. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces! Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to watch Catherine go.","How strange! I thought, although they all hated and despised each other, they couldn't help but love me. And they all became enemies within a few hours: That's what they are, these people. How terrible it is to face death, surrounded by their cold faces! Isabella, frightened and repulsed, was afraid to enter the room; how terrible it would be to see Catherine leave."
"And Edgar standing solemnly by to see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to his house, and going back to his BOOKS! What in the name of all that feels has he to do with BOOKS, when I am dying?' She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton's philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the north-east, and I objected.","And Edgar stood solemnly to finish it; then he thanked God for bringing peace back to his house, and turned again to his books! What can he have to do with books when I am dying? She could not bear the thought of Mr. Linton's philosophical resignation, which I had instilled in her. She tossed and turned, her feverish confusion turning into frenzy, and she tore the pillow with her teeth; then she sat up, all aflame, and begged me to open the window. It was the middle of winter, the wind was blowing hard from the northeast, and I protested."
"Both the expressions flitting over her face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations. 'That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself; 'and this is a wild duck's; and this is a pigeon's. Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows - no wonder I couldn't die! Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I lie down.","Her expression and mood swings began to disturb me terribly, reminding me of her previous illness and the doctor's instructions not to disturb her. A moment ago she had been violent; now, leaning on one arm and unaware that I disobeyed her, she seemed to amuse herself like a child, plucking the feathers from the tears she had just made and arranging them in a fancy manner on the sheet. Her mind was occupied with other associations. ""That's a turkey,"" she murmured; ""And that's a mallard; and that's a pigeon."" Ah, they tuck pigeon feathers into pillows! No wonder I can't die! I have to throw them on the floor when I lie down."
"And here is a moor-cock's; and this - I should know it among a thousand - it's a lapwing's. Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.","And here is a moorhen; and this one—I would recognize it among thousands—is a lapwing. A beautiful bird; it's circling above our heads, in the middle of the moor. It was heading for its nest, for the clouds were brushing the waves, and it sensed the rain coming."
"This feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn't.","This feather was plucked from the moor, but the bird wasn't shot: We saw its nest in winter, full of small skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap for it, and the old folks didn't dare come. I made him promise never to shoot a lapwing again, and he didn't."
"Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.' 'Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its contents by handfuls. 'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering. There's a mess! The down is flying about like snow.' I went here and there collecting it. 'I see in you, Nelly,' she continued dreamily, 'an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool.","Yes, there are more here! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are any red? Let's see. ""Don't be so motherly!"" I interrupted, pulling out the pillow and turning the holes toward the mattress, for she was busy emptying the contents by the handful. ""Lie down and close your eyes: you'll get lost. What a mess! The down is flying like snow."" I paced back and forth, gathering them up. ""I see you, Nelly,"" she continued dreamily, ""an old woman: you have gray hair and stooped shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave beneath the rocks of Penistone, and you collect fairy balls to torment our cows; as long as I'm here, you behave as if they were mere threads of wool."""
"That's what you'll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I'm not wandering: you're mistaken, or else I should believe you really WERE that withered hag, and I should think I WAS under Penistone Crags; and I'm conscious it's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet.' 'The black press? where is that?' I asked. 'You are talking in your sleep!' 'It's against the wall, as it always is,' she replied. 'It DOES appear odd - I see a face in it!' 'There's no press in the room, and never was,' said I, resuming my seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her. 'Don't YOU see that face?' she inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror. And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl. 'It's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously. 'And it stirred.","In fifty years you will be: I know you are not now. I digress: you are mistaken, otherwise I should think you really were that shriveled witch, and I should think I was beneath Penistone Crags; and I know it is night, and two candles are on the table, illuminating the pitch-black press. ""The black press? Where is it?"" I asked. ""You're talking in your sleep!"" ""It's against the wall, as always,"" she answered. ""It's very strange, I see a face in it!"" ""There is no press in the room, and there never was,"" I said, sitting down again and drawing the curtain so I could look at her. ""Don't you see that face?"" she asked, examining herself gravely in the mirror. And no matter what I said, I couldn't make her understand that it was her own face; so I got up and covered it with a shawl. ""It's still there!"" she continued anxiously. ""And it has moved."""
"Who is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the room is haunted! I'm afraid of being alone!' I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass. 'There's nobody here!' I insisted. 'It was YOURSELF, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.' 'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve! It's true, then! that's dreadful!' Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek - the shawl had dropped from the frame. 'Why, what is the matter?' cried I. 'Who is coward now? Wake up! That is the glass - the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and there am I too by your side.' Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame. 'Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,' she sighed. 'I thought I was lying in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I'm weak, my brain got confused, and I screamed unconsciously.","Who's there? I hope he doesn't come out while you're gone! Oh! Nelly, the room is haunted! I'm afraid to be alone! I took her hand in mine and told her to stay calm; for a shudder ran through her, and she kept her eyes fixed on the glass. ""There's no one here!"" I insisted. ""It was YOU, Mrs. Linton: you've known that for a while."" ""Me!"" she gasped, ""and the clock strikes twelve! Then it's true! It's horrible!"" Her fingers seized the clothes and pulled them over her eyes. I tried to creep to the door to call her husband; but a piercing scream pulled me back: the shawl had fallen from the frame. ""What's the matter?"" I cried. ""Who is that coward? Wake up!"" It's the glass, the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you recognize yourself in it, and I'm at your side."" Trembling and helpless, she held me tight, but the fear gradually faded from her face; the pallor gave way to a touch of shame. ""Oh dear! I thought I was home,"" she sighed. ""I thought I was in my room at Wuthering Heights. Because I was weak, my mind went wild, and I screamed unconsciously."""
"Don't say anything; but stay with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.' 'A sound sleep would do you good, ma'am,' I answered: 'and I hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.' 'Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!' she went on bitterly, wringing her hands. 'And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice. Do let me feel it - it comes straight down the moor - do let me have one breath!' To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.","Don't say anything, but stay with me. I'm afraid to sleep: my dreams worry me. ""A deep sleep would do you good, madam,"" I replied, ""and I hope this suffering saves you from starvation."" ""Oh, if only I were in my bed, in the old house!"" she continued bitterly, wringing her hands. ""And that wind howling in the firs on the trellis. Let me feel it, it comes straight from the moor, let me breathe a little!"" To calm her, I held the window ajar for a few seconds."
"A cold blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child. 'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly reviving. 'It was Monday evening,' I replied, 'and this is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, at present.' 'What! of the same week?' she exclaimed. 'Only that brief time?' 'Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,' observed I. 'Well, it seems a weary number of hours,' she muttered doubtfully: 'it must be more.","A cold gust of wind blew; I closed the door and returned to my seat. She lay motionless, her face streaming with tears. Physical exhaustion had completely overwhelmed her mind: our feisty Catherine was little more than a weeping child. ""How long has it been since I locked myself in here?"" she asked, suddenly coming to. ""That was Monday night,"" I replied, ""and today is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning."" ""What? In the same week?"" she exclaimed. ""So short?"" ""Long enough to survive on nothing but cold water and a bad temper,"" I remarked. ""Well, that seems like an exhausting number of hours,"" she murmured doubtfully. ""It must be more."""
"I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn't explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice.","I still remember being in the living room after their argument, where Edgar cruelly mocked me and I ran around the room frantically. As soon as I locked the door, deep darkness overcame me, and I collapsed. I couldn't explain to Edgar how certain I was that if he continued to tease me, I would have a fit or go completely mad! I had no control over my tongue or my mind, and perhaps he didn't suspect my fear: it barely gave me the strength to flee from him and his voice."
"Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at all.","Before I could see or hear well enough again, I had an epiphany, and Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought and what kept coming back to me until I was scared to death. I lay there, my head leaning against the table leg, my eyes only vaguely making out the gray square of the window. I thought I was home in that oak bed. And my heart broke with profound sadness: as soon as I woke up, I couldn't remember. I pondered, pondered, tried to figure out what it could be, and, the strangest thing of all: the last seven years of my life had been like an empty void! I couldn't even remember that they had been like that."
"I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause.","I was a child; my father had just been buried, and my unhappiness stemmed from the separation ordered by Hindley between me and Heathcliff. I was buried alone for the first time; and, awoke from a troubled sleep after a night of weeping, I raised my hand to part the tablets: it struck the tabletop! I passed it across the carpet, and suddenly the memory returned: my former anguish was swallowed up by a wave of despair. I cannot say why I felt so terribly unhappy; it must have been a temporary madness, for there is scarcely any reason for it."
"But, supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don't you move?' 'Because I won't give you your death of cold,' I answered. 'You won't give me a chance of life, you mean,' she said, sullenly. 'However, I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself.' And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.","But imagine if, at twelve, I had been torn from the High Plains, from all my first contacts, from everything else, like Heathcliff then, and changed at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the mistress of Thrushcross Grange and the wife of a stranger: an exile, an outcast, from that moment, from what had been my world. Imagine, you should have seen the abyss into which I had withdrawn! Shake your head, Nelly, you have unsettled me! You should have talked to Edgar, really, and made him leave me alone! Oh, I'm burning! I wish I were out! I wish I were a young girl again, half-wild, brave and free; laughing at insults, not mad! Why have I changed so? Why does my blood race at the slightest word? I am sure I would be myself if I were ever in the heather of these hills. Open the window wide! Quick, why don't you go? ""Because I don't want you to freeze,"" I replied. ""You mean you're not giving me a chance to live,"" she said grumpily. ""But I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself."" And before I could stop her, she slid out of bed, strode across the room, threw it back, and leaned forward, indifferent to the icy air that cut into her shoulders like a knife."
"I entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any house, far or near all had been extinguished long ago: and those at Wuthering Heights were never visible - still she asserted she caught their shining. 'Look!' she cried eagerly, 'that's my room with the candle in it, and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret.","I begged her and finally tried to force her to retreat. But I soon realized that her madness far exceeded mine (she was mad, as her subsequent actions and delusions clearly showed me). There was no moon, and everything below was in misty darkness: no light shone from any house, near or far; everything had long since gone out. And the houses of Wuthering Heights were nowhere to be seen—and yet she claimed to have glimpsed the light from them. ""Look!"" she cried eagerly, ""that is my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's attic."""
"Joseph sits up late, doesn't he? He's waiting till I come home that he may lock the gate. Well, he'll wait a while yet. It's a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that journey! We've braved its ghosts often together, and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.","Joseph stays up late, doesn't he? He's waiting for me to come home to close the gate. Well, he'll wait a little longer. It's a difficult, sad journey; and one has to go through Gimmerton Church to complete it! We've often braved his ghosts together, daring each other to stand among the graves and invite them to come."
"But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I'll keep you. I'll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the church down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me. I never will!' She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. 'He's considering - he'd rather I'd come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.","But, Heathcliff, if I challenge you now, will you dare? If so, I'll keep you. I won't stay there alone: They may bury me three meters deep and tear down the church over me, but I won't rest until you come. Never! She paused and continued with a strange smile. ""He's thinking—he'd rather I came to him! So find a way! Not through this cemetery."""
"You are slow! Be content, you always followed me!' Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour. 'Oh, sir!' I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. 'My poor mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all; pray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she's hard to guide any way but her own.' 'Catherine ill?' he said, hastening to us. 'Shut the window, Ellen! Catherine! why - ' He was silent.","""You are slow! Be content, you have always followed me!"" I realized it was useless to argue with her madness and was seeking some way of binding her without yielding (for I could not trust her through the gaping grate alone), when, to my great horror, I heard the rattle of the doorknob and Mr. Linton's entrance. He was coming from the library; crossing the hall, he had noticed our conversation and, from curiosity or fear at this late hour, had inquired its meaning. ""Oh, sir!"" I cried, suppressing the exclamation that escaped him at the sight before his eyes and the gloomy atmosphere of the room. ""My poor mistress is ill, and she is entirely my mistress: I can do nothing for her; come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she is difficult to control, except her own."" ""Catherine is ill?"" he asked, hurrying towards us. “Close the window, Ellen! Catherine!” Why…” He paused."
"The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment. 'She's been fretting here,' I continued, 'and eating scarcely anything, and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and so we couldn't inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it ourselves; but it is nothing.' I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. 'It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?' he said sternly. 'You shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!' And he took his wife in his arms, and looked at her with anguish. At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her. 'Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?' she said, with angry animation. 'You are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now - I see we shall - but they can't keep me from my narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I'm bound before spring is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me!' 'Catherine, what have you done?' commenced the master. 'Am I nothing to you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath - ' 'Hush!' cried Mrs. Linton. 'Hush, this moment! You mention that name and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before you lay hands on me again.","Mrs. Linton's emaciated appearance left him speechless, and his gaze could only stare at her and then at me, full of horror and astonishment. ""She's complaining here,"" I continued, ""she hardly eats and never complains: until this evening she hasn't let anyone in, and that's why we couldn't inform you of her condition, as we ourselves knew nothing about it; but it's nothing."" I found my explanations clumsy; the gentleman frowned. ""It's nothing, isn't it, Ellen Dean?"" he said sternly. ""You'll have to justify yourself even more than you have, for leaving me in the dark!"" He took his wife in his arms and looked at her anxiously. At first, she didn't recognize him at first glance; he was invisible to her distracted gaze. But her delirium had not subsided; having left the darkness, she gradually turned her attention back to him and discovered who was holding her. ""Ah! They're here, aren't they, Edgar Linton?"" she said with furious fervor. ""You're one of those creatures you always find when you least want them, and never when they want you! I suppose we shall have much to complain about now—I can see that—but they can't keep me from going to my narrow house outside: my resting place, where I go before the spring is over! Here it is: not to the Lintons', mind you, under the roof of the chapel, but out in the open, with a tombstone; and you can choose whether you go to them or to me!"" ""Catherine, what have you done?"" began the gentleman. ""Am I nothing to you? Do you love this miserable Heath—"" ""Shh!"" cried Mrs. Linton. ""Shh, now!"" If you speak that name, I'll put an end to it all at once by jumping out of the window! What you touch now is yours; but my soul will be on that hill before you catch me again."""
"I don't want you, Edgar: I'm past wanting you. Return to your books. I'm glad you possess a consolation, for all you had in me is gone.' 'Her mind wanders, sir,' I interposed. 'She has been talking nonsense the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and she'll rally.","I don't need you, Edgar. I haven't needed you in a long time. Go back to work. I'm glad you've calmed down, because whatever attraction you had for me is gone. ""Her mind is wandering, sir,"" I interrupted. ""She's been talking nonsense all evening; but let her be quiet and listen carefully, and she'll calm down."""
"Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.' 'I desire no further advice from you,' answered Mr. Linton. 'You knew your mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was heartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!' I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's wicked waywardness. 'I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and domineering,' cried I: 'but I didn't know that you wished to foster her fierce temper! I didn't know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant's wages! Well, it will teach me to be careful next time.","""From now on, you must be careful how you disturb her."" ""I need no further advice from you,"" replied Mr. Linton. ""You knew your mistress's temper and encouraged me to disturb her. And you haven't let me know the slightest bit about her condition for the past three days! It was cruel! Months of illness could not have brought about such a change!"" I began to defend myself, feeling it a pity to be accused of someone else's malice. ""I knew Mrs. Linton was willful and domineering,"" I exclaimed, ""but I didn't know you were trying to stir up her passion! I didn't know I would wink at Mr. Heathcliff to please her. I have fulfilled my duty as a faithful servant by telling you this, and I have a faithful servant's reward! Well, this will be a lesson to me to be careful next time."""
"Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!' 'The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen Dean,' he replied. 'You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?' said I. 'Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the mistress against you?' Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our conversation. 'Ah! Nelly has played traitor,' she exclaimed, passionately. 'Nelly is my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me go, and I'll make her rue! I'll make her howl a recantation!' A maniac's fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to disengage herself from Linton's arms. I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber.","Next time, get your own information! ""The next time you tell me a story, you must leave my service, Ellen Dean,"" he replied. ""Then I suppose you'd rather not hear it, Mr. Linton?"" I asked. ""Heathcliff has your permission to pay court to Miss and visit her on every occasion of your absence, to turn the mistress against you?"" Despondent as she was, Catherine was aware of the idea of making our conversation a topic. ""Ah! Nelly has betrayed me!"" she cried passionately. ""Nelly is my secret enemy. Witch! Then you are looking for fairy lightning to harm us! Let me go, and I will make her repent! I will make her recant!"" Wild rage seized her; she struggled desperately to free herself from Linton's arms. Seeing no reason to delay the event, I determined to seek medical help myself and left the room."
"In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.","As I crossed the garden to reach the street, I noticed something white moving erratically. Apparently, it wasn't the wind, but a bridle driven into the wall. Despite my haste, I paused to examine it, fearing that one day I would be convinced it was a creature from another world. My surprise and confusion were great when I discovered Miss Isabella's little springer spaniel, Fanny, hanging from a handkerchief, near death, more by touch than by sight."
"I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so. While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the morning.","I quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up the stairs as she went to bed; and I wondered how it had gotten there and what wicked person had treated it so. As I untied the knot in the hook, I thought I heard the rhythm of galloping horse hooves in the distance several times; but so many things preoccupied me that I hardly noticed it, even though it was a strange sound in that place at two in the morning."
"Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine Linton's malady induced him to accompany me back immediately. He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before. 'Nelly Dean,' said he, 'I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We've odd reports up here.","Fortunately, Mr. Kenneth had just left his house to visit a patient in the village when I stepped out onto the street. My account of Catherine Linton's illness prompted him to return with me immediately. He was a rather outspoken man; he didn't hesitate to express his doubts about whether she would survive this second attack if she didn't obey his instructions even more strictly than before. ""Nelly Dean,"" he said, ""I can't help thinking there's another reason for this. What happened at the Grange? We have some strange news here."""
"A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It's hard work bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?' 'The master will inform you,' I answered; 'but you are acquainted with the Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.","A strong, robust girl like Catherine doesn't get sick for nothing; and neither should such people. It's hard work helping them with fevers and the like. How did it all begin? ""The Lord will tell you,"" I replied; ""but you know the Earnshaws' aggressive temper, and Mrs. Linton is the icing on the cake."""
"I may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit. That's her account, at least: for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.","All I can say is: It all started with an argument. She had a tantrum during a tantrum. At least, that's her story: At the height of the attack, she ran away and locked herself in."
"Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.' 'Mr. Linton will be sorry?' observed Kenneth, interrogatively. ' Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied. 'Don't alarm him more than necessary.' 'Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn't he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff lately?' 'Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,' answered I, 'though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because the master likes his company. At present he's discharged from the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he'll be taken in again.' 'And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next question. 'I'm not in her confidence,' returned I, reluctant to continue the subject. 'No, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head. 'She keeps her own counsel! But she's a real little fool.","After that, she refused to eat and now vacillates between wandering and daydreaming; she knows the people around her, but her head is full of strange ideas and illusions. ""Will Mr. Linton regret it?"" Kenneth asked questioningly. ""I regret it? It would break her heart if anything happened!"" I replied. ""Don't worry him more than necessary."" ""Well, I told him to be careful,"" said my companion; ""and he must suffer the consequences of his indifference to my warning! Hasn't he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff lately?"" ""Heathcliff is a frequent guest at the Grange,"" I replied, ""but more because the mistress knew him as a child than because the master enjoys his company. For the time being, he is exempt from visits, thanks to some presumptuous requests he has expressed to Miss Linton."" I don't think he will be kissed again. ""And Miss Linton turns her back on him?"" was the doctor's next question. ""I don't trust her,"" I replied, hesitating to continue. ""No, she's a shrewd woman,"" he remarked, shaking his head. ""She keeps her opinions to herself! But she's a real idiot."""
"I have it from good authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was to be he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!' This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.","I have it on good authority that last night (and it was a fine night!) she and Heathcliff walked for over two hours in the grass behind your house; and he urged her not to turn back, but simply to mount and walk! My informant told me the only way to dissuade him was to give her his word of honor to be ready for their next meeting: when she arrived, he heard nothing; but you urge Mr. Linton to be on his guard! This news filled me with new anxiety; I overtook Kenneth and ran almost all the way home. The little dog was still whining in the garden. I took a moment to open the gate for him, but instead of going to the front door, he paced up and down, sniffing the grass, and would have run out into the street if I hadn't grabbed him and carried him inside."
"On ascending to Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly.","When I reached Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty. If I'd been there a few hours earlier, Mrs. Linton's illness might have prevented her from leaving so quickly. But what could I do now? I had little chance of catching them if they were immediately pursued."
"I could not pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features. The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.","However, I couldn't pursue them; and I didn't dare wake the family and stir up tensions, let alone speak of them to my master, who was so absorbed in his present misfortune and incapable of a second sorrow! I saw no other option than to remain silent and let things take their course; and when Kenneth arrived, I went to his house in a bad mood to announce him. Catherine slept restlessly: her husband had managed to calm his excessive fury; now he hovered over his pillow, observing every shadow and every change in his painfully expressive features. The doctor, who was investigating the case himself, told her hopefully that the outcome would be favorable if we could only provide her with complete and constant rest."
"To me, he signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect. I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.","He meant that the impending danger was not so much death as a permanent mental alienation. I did not sleep a wink that night, nor did Mr. Linton; we did not go to bed at all; and the servants were all up long before the usual time, stealing stealthily about the house and exchanging whispered words whenever they met at work. Everyone was busy except Miss Isabella; and they noticed that she was fast asleep. Her brother, too, asked her if she was awake and seemed impatient with her presence, mortified that she cared so little for her sister-in-law."
"I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master, master, our young lady - ' 'Hold your noise!' cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner. 'Speak lower, Mary - What is the matter?' said Mr. Linton. 'What ails your young lady?' 'She's gone, she's gone! Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the girl. 'That is not true!' exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. 'It cannot be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It is incredible: it cannot be.' As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion. 'Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered, 'and he asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange.","I trembled lest he should send for her; but I need not suffer the agony of being the first to announce her escape. One of the maids, a thoughtless young woman who had started early for Gimmerton, came panting upstairs with her mouth wide open, burst into the room, and cried: ""Oh dear! What is the matter? Sir, sir, our young lady—"" ""Be quiet!"" I cried hastily, incensed at her effusive behavior. ""Speak more quietly, Mary—what is the matter?"" demanded Mr. Linton. ""What is the matter with your young lady?"" ""She's gone, she's gone! That Heathcliff has run away with her!"" cried the girl. ""It's not true!"" cried Linton, rising in agitation. ""It's impossible: what makes you think so? Ellen Dean, go and see her."" It's incredible: it's impossible."" As he spoke, he led the maid to the door and repeated his question as to why she had said that. ""Well, on my way to get milk, I met a boy,"" she stammered, ""and he asked us if we were having any problems at the Grange."""
"I thought he meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ""There's somebody gone after 'em, I guess?"" I stared. He saw I knew nought about it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy who they were: she knew them both directly.","I thought he meant the lady was ill, and said, ""Yes."" Then he said, ""Someone's been following her, I suppose?"" I looked at him intently. He saw I knew nothing about it and told me how, just after midnight, a man and a woman had stopped at a blacksmith's two miles from Gimmerton to have a horseshoe made! And how the farrier's wife had gotten up to see who they were: she knew them both personally."
"And she noticed the man - Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob'dy could mistake him, besides - put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment. The lady had a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and went as fast as the rough roads would let them.","And she saw the man—it was Heathcliff, she was sure; besides, no one could mistake him—press a sovereign into her father's hand as payment. The lady had wrapped a cloak around her face; but after asking for a drink of water, it fell back as she drank, and she looked completely changed. Heathcliff held both reins as they rode on, and they left the village as quickly as the bumpy roads allowed."
"The lass said nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.' I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when I returned, the servant's statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a word. 'Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' I inquired. 'How should we do?' 'She went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her.","The girl didn't tell her father, but this morning she told all of Gimmerton. I ran and, for formality's sake, peeped into Isabella's room. When I returned, I confirmed the servant's statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his position by the bed. When I returned, he looked up, guessed my blank expression, and lowered his eyes without giving an order or saying a word. ""Shall we do something to catch her and bring her back?"" I asked. ""How?"" ""She left of her own free will,"" replied the master; ""she had every right to go if she wanted to. Don't bother me with her again."""
"Hereafter she is only my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.' And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make single inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it. FOR two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her.","From now on, she is my sister in name only: not because I have cast her out, but because she has cast me out."" And that was all he said on the subject: he asked no further questions or mentioned her in any way, except that he ordered her to send all her belongings to her new home, wherever that may be, as soon as I know. For two months the refugees remained absent; during those two months Mrs. Linton endured and overcame the most dreadful shock of what is called encephalitis. No mother could have cared for an only child with such devotion as Edgar had cared for his."
"Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety - in fact, that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity - he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely her former self. The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together. 'These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed. 'They remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.","Day and night he watched, patiently enduring all the discomforts that frayed nerves and a troubled mind could bring. And although Kenneth realized that what he had saved from the grave would only compensate for his fears by filling him with constant anxiety about the future—that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a devastated humanity—he felt boundless gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared saved. Hour after hour, he sat by her side, watching her gradually regain physical health and comforting her overly optimistic hopes with the illusion that her mind, too, would soon regain its balance and she would soon be herself again. The first time she left her room was early in March of the following year. Mr. Linton had placed a handful of golden crocuses on her pillow that morning. Her eyes, long without a glimmer of joy, caught sight of them upon waking and beamed with joy as she eagerly plucked them. ""These are the first flowers of the heights,"" she exclaimed. ""They remind me of the gentle dew, the warm sun, and the almost melted snow."""
"Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?' 'The snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.' 'I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then you'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you'll long again to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were happy to-day.' Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.","Edgar, isn't the south wind blowing, and isn't the snow almost gone? 'Here the snow is all gone, my dear,' replied her husband; 'and I see only two white patches on the whole heath: the sky is blue, the larks are singing, and the streams are overflowing. Catherine, last spring, at this time, I longed to have you under this roof; now I wish you were a few miles away, on these hills: the air blows so sweet that it would heal you.' 'I will never come here more than once,' said the sick man; 'and then you will leave me, and I will stay forever. Next spring you will long to have me under this roof, and you will remember how happy you were today.' Linton showered her with his tenderest caresses and tried to console her with the sweetest words; But as she glanced at the flowers, tears gathered in her eyelashes and carelessly ran down her cheeks."
"We knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to light a fire in the many-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared.","We knew she was really improving and therefore concluded that her prolonged confinement to one and the same place was largely responsible for her depression, and that a change of air might alleviate it somewhat. The professor instructed me to light a fire in the parlor, which had been deserted for weeks, and to place a comfortable armchair by the window in the sun. He then led her downstairs, and there she sat for a long time, enjoying the pleasant warmth. As expected, the objects around her comforted her: although familiar, they were far removed from the grim memories that surrounded her hated sickroom. Towards evening, she seemed exhausted; but no amount of persuasion could induce her to return to the room, and I had to make a bed for her on the parlor sofa until another room was ready."
"To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present - on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm. Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.","To avoid the effort of climbing stairs, we arranged the place where you now lie on the same floor as the living room. Soon she was strong enough to walk from one floor to another, supported by Edgar's arm. Ah! I thought she would recover if she was well cared for. And there was a double reason to hope so, for someone else's existence depended on her: We cherished the hope that Mr. Linton would soon be satisfied, and his fortune would be saved from the clutches of a stranger thanks to the birth of an heir."
"I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon.","It should be noted that about six weeks before her departure, Isabella had sent her brother a short note announcing her marriage to Heathcliff. The text seemed cold and dry, but at the end was a vague, penciled apology, accompanied by a request for remembrance and reconciliation if her behavior had offended him. She claimed she could do nothing about it at the time, and now that she was done, she had no power to reverse her decision. I don't think Linton replied; and two weeks later, I received a long letter, which I found odd, written by a bride returning from her honeymoon."
"I'll read it: for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living. DEAR ELLEN, it begins, - I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.","I'll read it because I'll always keep it. Every relic of a dead person is precious if you cherish it while you're still alive. DEAR ELLEN, it begins like this: ""I arrived at Wuthering Heights last night and learned for the first time that Catherine was, and still is, gravely ill."""
"I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you. Inform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again - that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine! I CAN'T FOLLOW IT THOUGH - (these words are underlined) - they need not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection.","I don't think I'm allowed to write to him, and my brother is either too angry or too upset to reply to my message. But I must write to someone, and there's no one left but you. Tell Edgar that I would give anything to see him again—that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange within 24 hours of my leaving, and is now there, filled with tenderness for him and Catherine! I cannot follow, even if—(these words are underlined)—they do not have to wait for me and can draw their own conclusions; but see that my weakness of will or lack of affection does not embarrass me."
"The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you two questions: the first is, - How did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me. The second question I have great interest in; it is this - Is Mr. Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I sha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.","The rest of this letter is addressed to you alone. I have two questions to ask you: First, how have you managed to retain human sympathy here? I detect no feelings shared by those around you. The second question interests me greatly: Is Mr. Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I will not reveal the reasons for this question, but I earnestly beg you, if possible, to explain to me to whom I am married: that is, when you come to visit me; and you must come very soon, Ellen."
"Don't write, but come, and bring me something from Edgar. Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.","Don't write to me, but bring me something from Edgar. Now you'll learn how I was welcomed into my new home, exactly as I imagine it in the Heights. For entertainment, I reflect on topics like the lack of external comforts: they never concern me, except when I miss them."
"I should laugh and dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and the rest was an unnatural dream! The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn away.","I would laugh and dance for joy if I discovered that her absence was the culmination of my misfortune, and the rest a supernatural dream! The sun was setting behind the manor as we turned toward the moor; from then on, I judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion remained for half an hour, inspecting the park, the gardens, and probably the place itself, as best he could; thus, it was dark when we landed in the paved court, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, came to meet us by candlelight. He did this with a courtesy that did him credit. His first act was to thrust the torch into my face, wink spitefully, curl his lip, and turn away."
"Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle. Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen - a dingy, untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth. 'This is Edgar's legal nephew,' I reflected - 'mine in a manner; I must shake hands, and - yes - I must kiss him.","Then he took the two horses and led them to the stable; when he returned, he locked the outer door as if we were living in an old castle. Heathcliff stayed to talk with him, and I went into the kitchen—a dirty, cluttered study; I bet you wouldn't notice, so changed has it been since you left it. By the fire stood a naughty child, stout and in dirty clothes, with a Catherine look in her eyes and on her mouth. ""This is Edgar's legitimate nephew,"" I thought—""mine in a way; I must shake his hand and—yes—I must kiss him."""
"It is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning.' I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said - 'How do you do, my dear?' He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend. 'Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?' was my next essay at conversation. An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 'frame off' rewarded my perseverance. 'Hey, Throttler, lad!' whispered the little wretch, rousing a half- bred bull-dog from its lair in a corner. 'Now, wilt thou be ganging?' he asked authoritatively. Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter.","""It's good to make good contact at the beginning."" I walked over, tried to grab his thick fist, and asked, ""How are you, my dear?"" He answered in gibberish I didn't understand. ""Shall we be friends, Hareton?"" was my next attempt at conversation. A curse and the threat of sending Throttler after me if I didn't run away rewarded my persistence. ""Hey, Throttler, boy!"" muttered the little brat, dragging a bulldog mix from its den in a corner. ""Now, are you going to get to work?"" he demanded imperiously. The love of my life forced me to agree; I crossed the threshold to wait for the others to come in."
"Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and replied - 'Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it? Mincing un' munching! How can I tell whet ye say?' 'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!' I cried, thinking him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness. 'None o' me! I getten summut else to do,' he answered, and continued his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt. I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and HIS eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty annihilated. 'What's your business here?' he demanded, grimly. 'Who are you?' 'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied. 'You've seen me before, sir.","Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere to be seen; and Joseph, whom I had followed to the stables, and invited to come in with me, after staring and muttering, wrinkled his nose and answered, ""Mim! Mim! Mim! Did a Christian ever hear of such a thing? Clacking and clacking! How shall I know what you say?"" ""I tell you, I will have you come in with me!"" I cried, believing him deaf, but deeply indignant at his discourtesy. ""Not from me! I have other things to do,"" he replied, continuing his work. Meanwhile, waving the beam of his lantern, he examined my clothes and my face (the one much too fine, but the other, I am sure, as piteous as he could wish) with the utmost contempt. I walked around the courtyard and through a small door to another, where I allowed myself to knock, hoping another official would appear. After a moment of waiting, a tall, thin man opened the door. He wore no headscarf and was completely disheveled. His face was lost in a mass of matted hair that fell over his shoulders. His eyes, too, resembled those of a ghostly Catherine, her beauty completely destroyed. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked gloomily. ""Who are you?"" ""My name was Isabella Linton,"" I replied. ""You've seen me before, sir."""
"I'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here - I suppose, by your permission.' 'Is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf. 'Yes - we came just now,' I said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.' 'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him. I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.","I recently married Mr. Heathcliff, and he brought me here, presumably with your permission. ""So he's back?"" asked the hermit, furious as a hungry wolf. ""Yes, we just arrived,"" I said; ""but he dropped me off at the kitchen door; and when I was about to go in, your little boy was standing guard and chased me out with the help of a bulldog. Fortunately, that scoundrel kept his word!"" growled my prospective host, peering into the darkness behind me, expecting to find Heathcliff; then he launched into a monologue of curses and threats about what he would have done if the ""devil"" had betrayed him. I regretted this second attempt and was almost tempted to slip away before he had finished cursing, but before I could carry out my resolution, he bade me enter, closed the door, and locked it again. A large fire burned and was the only light in the enormous apartment. The floor had turned a solid gray. Even the once-gleaming pewter dishes that had caught my eye as a child had been plunged into a similar darkness by dirt and dust."
"I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him again. You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass them! I questioned with myself - where must I turn for comfort? and - mind you don't tell Edgar, or Catherine - above every sorrow beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their intermeddling.","I asked if I could call the chambermaid and have her show me a room! Mr. Earnshaw didn't answer. He paced the room with his hands in his pockets, apparently utterly unaware of my presence; and his absence was so marked and his manner so misanthropic that I hesitated to disturb him again. It will not surprise you, Ellen, that I felt particularly oppressed as I sat in more than profound solitude in the corner of that inhospitable fireplace, thinking that my beautiful home, with the only people I loved in the world, was only four miles away; and as far as the Atlantic separated us, instead of those four miles: I could not cross it! I asked myself: Where would I find comfort? And—mind you, don't tell Edgar or Catherine this—most of all, I was pained by the despair of finding no one who could or would ally me against Heathcliff! I would have been almost glad to find refuge at Wuthering Heights, for, thanks to that arrangement, I would not have had to live alone with him. But he knew the people we were visiting and wasn't afraid that they might disturb us."
"I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.","I sat there, reflecting on a sad moment: The clock struck eight, nine, and my companion continued pacing the room, his head bowed on his chest, completely motionless, only occasionally uttering bitter sighs or exclamations. I waited for a woman's voice in the house and filled the pause with angry regret and gloomy anticipation, which finally expressed itself in uncontrollable sighs and tears. I didn't realize how obvious my grief was until Earnshaw stopped in front of me with measured steps and looked at me with a look of renewed surprise."
"Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed - 'I'm tired with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant? Direct me to her, as she won't come to me!' 'We have none,' he answered; 'you must wait on yourself!' 'Where must I sleep, then?' I sobbed; I was beyond regarding self- respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness. 'Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,' said he; 'open that door - he's in there.' I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the strangest tone - 'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your bolt - don't omit it!' 'Well!' I said. 'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?' I did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff. 'Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a curiously- constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached to the barrel. 'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door. If once I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!' I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.","Taking advantage of his renewed attention, I cried, ""I am tired with the journey and wish to go to bed! Where is the chambermaid? Take me to her, for she refuses to come to me!"" ""We have none,"" he replied; ""you must take care of yourself!"" ""Then where shall I sleep?"" I sobbed; I had already exceeded the bounds of my self-respect, crushed by weariness and despair. ""Joseph will show you Heathcliff's room,"" he said; ""open the door, there he is."" I was about to obey, but he stopped me abruptly and added in a strange tone, ""Be so good as to close your lock and draw the bolt—don't do that!"" ""Well!"" I asked. ""But why, Mr. Earnshaw?"" I had no wish to deliberately bind myself to Heathcliff. ""You see!"" ""He replied, pulling from his vest a strangely constructed pistol with a double-edged, spring-loaded knife on the barrel. ""That's a real temptation for a desperate man, isn't it? I can't help going upstairs with it every night and trying to open his door. When I find it open, he's furious; I always do, even if I've already thought of a thousand and one reasons not to: he's a demon urging me to thwart my own plans by killing him. Fight this demon for love while you can; when the time comes, all the angels in heaven won't save him!"" I examined the weapon carefully."
"A hideous notion struck me: how powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his hand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was covetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife, and returned it to its concealment. 'I don't care if you tell him,' said he. 'Put him on his guard, and watch for him.","A terrible thought struck me: How powerful I would be with such a tool! I took it from his hand and touched the blade. He seemed surprised by the expression that instantly came over my face: It wasn't disgust, it was greed. Jealously, he drew the gun, closed the knife, and put it back in its hiding place. ""I don't care if you tell him,"" he said. ""Keep him on guard and watch him."""
"You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not shock you.' 'What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked. 'In what has he wronged you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit the house?' 'No!' thundered Earnshaw; 'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose ALL, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh, damnation! I WILL have it back; and I'll have HIS gold too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before!' You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits. He is clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable.","You know our position, I see: his danger does not shock you. ""What has Heathcliff done to you?"" I asked. ""What has he done to you to justify this vile hatred? Would it not be wiser to ask him to leave the house?"" ""No!"" thundered Earnshaw. ""If he proposes to leave me, he is lost. Persuade him to try, and you are a murderer! Am I to lose everything, with no chance of recovery? Am I to become a beggar? Oh, good heavens! I shall have him back; and I shall have his gold too; and then his blood; and hell will have his soul! It will be ten times blacker for that man than ever! You have initiated me into your old master's ways, Ellen. He is clearly on the verge of madness: at least, he was last night. I shuddered at the thought of his proximity, and found the servant's rude and uncouth behavior rather agreeable."
"He now recommenced his moody walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, 'I'LL make the porridge!' I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. 'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued, 'directs me to wait on myself: I will.","He resumed his grumpy pacing, and I pulled the latch to slip into the kitchen. Joseph leaned over the fire and peered into a large pot hanging over it; beside it stood a wooden bowl of porridge on the bench. The contents of the pot began to boil, and he turned to dip his hand in. I guessed this dish was probably intended for our supper, and since I was hungry, I thought it must be edible. So I called out sharply, ""I'm making the porridge!"" I placed the pot out of his reach and began to take off my hat and overalls. ""Mr. Earnshaw,"" I continued, ""orders me to help myself. I will."""
"I'm not going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.' 'Gooid Lord!' he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle. 'If there's to be fresh ortherings - just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a MISTRESS set o'er my heead, it's like time to be flitting. I niver DID think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place - but I doubt it's nigh at hand!' This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water.","""I won't pretend to be the lady among you for fear of starving."" ""Good God!"" he murmured, sitting down and smoothing his ribbed stockings from knee to ankle. ""When the new world comes—just when I'm getting used to two masters, when I have a LADY over me—it's time to run away. I never thought I could leave this place—but I doubt it will be soon!"" This complaint left me unheeded: I hurried to work, sighing at the memory of a time when all had been joy; but I had to banish the memory quickly. The memory of past happiness tormented me, and the greater the danger of remembering it, the faster the rod spun and the faster the handfuls of flour fell into the water."
"Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation. 'Thear!' he ejaculated. 'Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge to-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear, agean! I'd fling in bowl un' all, if I wer ye! There, pale t' guilp off, un' then ye'll hae done wi' 't. Bang, bang.","Joseph watched me cook with growing indignation. ""Hey!"" he shouted. ""Hareton, you're not eating your porridge; it's just lumps the size of my belly."" ""Hey, man! If I were you, I'd put it all in a bowl! Here, pale with guilt, because after that, it's all over."" Boom, boom."
"It's a mercy t' bothom isn't deaved out!' It WAS rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me, repeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as wollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.","Fortunately, the froth didn't dry out! I confess it was a real mess when the milk was poured into the bowls; four had been set out, and a jug of fresh milk was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and began to drink, the milk flowing over the wide rim. I protested, wishing he would drink his from a jug; I assured him that I couldn't taste the mistreated liquid. The old cynic was deeply offended by this politeness; he assured me several times that ""the barn was just as good"" as I was, ""and just as woolly,"" and wondered how I could be so conceited."
"Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug. 'I shall have my supper in another room,' I said. 'Have you no place you call a parlour?' 'PARLOUR!' he echoed, sneeringly, 'PARLOUR! Nay, we've noa PARLOURS. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un' if yah dunnut loike maister, there's us.' 'Then I shall go up-stairs,' I answered; 'show me a chamber.' I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the apartments we passed. 'Here's a rahm,' he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on hinges. 'It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.","Meanwhile, the little rascal continued drinking, giving me a defiant look as he drooled into his glass. ""I'm eating in another room,"" I said. ""Don't you have a living room?"" ""Parreau!"" he repeated mockingly. ""Parreau! No, we don't have a living room. In case you don't know where we are, this is the master's house; and in case you don't know where we are, here we are."" ""Then I'll go upstairs,"" I replied; ""show me a room."" I put my bowl on a tray and fetched some milk myself. Grumbling, the man got up and led the way. We went up to the attic, opening a door every now and then to peek into the rooms we passed. ""Here's a cream,"" he said finally, pushing aside a small, rickety shelf. ""There's enough porridge to eat."""
"There's a pack o' corn i' t' corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye're feared o' muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on't.' The 'rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain; various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare space in the middle. 'Why, man,' I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 'this is not a place to sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.' 'BED-RUME!' he repeated, in a tone of mockery. 'Yah's see all t' BED-RUMES thear is - yon's mine.' He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end. 'What do I want with yours?' I retorted. 'I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house, does he?' 'Oh! it's Maister HATHECLIFF'S ye're wanting?' cried he, as if making a new discovery. 'Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? un' then, I mud ha' telled ye, baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see - he allas keeps it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln.' 'You've a nice house, Joseph,' I could not refrain from observing, 'and pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose - there are other rooms. For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!' He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.","""There's a bundle of grain in the corner, my dear and honorable family; if you're afraid of soiling your heavy silk coats, spread your handkerchief over them."" The ""cream"" was a sort of storeroom that smelled strongly of malt and grain; various sacks of things were stacked all around it, leaving a large empty space in the middle. ""Good heavens!"" I cried, staring at him, ""this is no place to sleep. I want to see my room."" ""BEDROOM!"" he repeated mockingly. ""You can see the whole BEDROOM here—it's mine."" He pointed to the second attic, which differed from the first only in having fewer covered walls and a large, low bed without curtains, with an indigo quilt on one side. ""What would you like me to do with yours?"" I replied. ""I suppose Mr. Heathcliff doesn't live upstairs, does he?"" ""Oh! Are you looking for Master Heathcliff's room?"" he cried, as if he had made a new discovery. ""Couldn't you have told me right away? I could have told you, but with all the work, there's only one room you can't see: he locks it so no one but himself can hear it."" ""You have a beautiful house, Joseph,"" I couldn't help remarking, ""and lovely residents; and I think the epitome of all the madness in the world took root in my mind the day I joined my fate to theirs! But that's not the point: there are other rooms. Come quickly and let me live somewhere!"" He didn't respond to this incantation; he simply trudged down the wooden stairs and stopped outside a room that I considered the best for its peace and quality of furnishings."
"There was a carpet - a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession, when my fool of a guide announced, - 'This here is t' maister's.' My supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience exhausted.","There was a carpet—a beautiful carpet, but its pattern discolored by dust; a mantelpiece littered with scraps of paper; a fine oak bedstead hung with wide, crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern manufacture; but they had obviously been badly treated: the flounces hung in loops torn from their rings, and the iron rod that held them was twisted at one end, so that the curtains dragged on the floor. The chairs, too, were damaged, often heavy, and deep dents warped the wainscoting. I was about to go in and take them when my rather foolish guide announced, ""This is from the master."" My dinner was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience at an end."
"I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge, and means of repose. 'Whear the divil?' began the religious elder. 'The Lord bless us! The Lord forgie us! Whear the HELL wdd ye gang? ye marred, wearisome nowt! Ye've seen all but Hareton's bit of a cham'er. There's not another hoile to lig down in i' th' hahse!' I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then seated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried. 'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph. 'Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss Cathy! Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brooken pots; un' then we's hear summut; we's hear how it's to be. Gooid-for-naught madling! ye desarve pining fro' this to Churstmas, flinging t' precious gifts o'God under fooit i' yer flaysome rages! But I'm mista'en if ye shew yer sperrit lang.","I insisted on finding refuge and a place to rest immediately. ""Where in God's name?"" began the spiritual elder. ""The Lord bless us! May he forgive us! Where are you? You maimed, tiresome wretches! You've seen everything except Hareton's little fellow. There's no room to sleep in this prison!"" I was so angry that I threw my tray and its contents to the floor. Then I sat down on the steps with my hands over my face and screamed. ""Oh! Oh!"" cried Joseph. ""Well done, Miss Cathy! Well done, Miss Cathy! But the Master will overturn these pots. And then we'll hear the end of it; we'll hear how it's meant to be. Nonsense! You shall never miss Christmas again and throw away God's precious gifts in your furious rage! But I am wrong when you show your strength."""
"Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I nobbut wish he may catch ye i' that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.' And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.","Do you think Hathecliff will behave so well? I truly hope he doesn't surprise you there. I truly hope he doesn't surprise you."" So he continued his rebukes in his hiding place, taking the candle with him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection that followed this foolish act forced me to realize that I must suppress my pride and anger and try to eliminate the consequences."
"An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.","Soon an unexpected assistant appeared in the form of Throttler, whom I now recognized as the son of our old Skulker: he had spent his childhood at the Grange and had been placed with Mr. Hindley by my father. I suppose he knew me: he gave me a gentle elbow nudge in greeting and then hurried off to eat the porridge, while I staggered from step to step, picking up broken dishes and wiping the milk splashes on the banisters with my handkerchief. Our work was hardly finished when I heard Earnshaw's footsteps in the hall; my assistant tucked his tail between his legs and pressed himself against the wall; I squeezed myself into the nearest doorway."
"The dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed.","The dog's attempt to evade him failed; as I had suspected, a rustling downstairs and a long, pitiful whine drove him to flee. I had better luck: he continued on his way, entered his room, and closed the door. Immediately afterwards, Joseph went upstairs with Hareton to put him to bed."
"I had found shelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said, - 'They's rahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's empty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him as allus maks a third, i' sich ill company!' Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was deep and sweet, though over far too soon.","I had sought refuge in Hareton's room, and when the old man saw me, he said, ""They are kind to you, your pride, and now I think the house is empty. It is empty; you can keep it to yourself, while He makes us a third party in such bad company!"" I gladly took advantage of this information, and as soon as I sank into an armchair by the fire, I dozed off and fell asleep. My sleep was deep and sweet, though too quick."
"Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there? I told him the cause of my staying up so late - that he had the key of our room in his pocket. The adjective OUR gave mortal offence. He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd - but I'll not repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens.","Mr. Heathcliff woke me; he had just come in and asked me kindly what I was doing there. I explained to him why I had stayed up so late: he had the key to our room in his pocket. The adjective ""our"" was terribly insulting. He swore it was not mine and never would be mine; and he did, but I shall not repeat his words, nor describe his usual behavior: he is resourceful and unwearying in his efforts to excite my horror! Sometimes I marvel at him with an intensity that numbs my fears; yet, I assure you, a tiger or a poisonous snake could not frighten me so much."
"He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of causing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he could get hold of him. I do hate him - I am wretched - I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every day - don't disappoint me! - ISABELLA.","He told me about Catherine's illness and accused my brother of being the cause. He promised to take Edgar's place in his suffering until he could cure him. I truly hate him, I'm unhappy, I've been stupid! Be careful not to tell anyone at the Grange. I wait for you every day, don't disappoint me! – ISABELLA."
"AS soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me. 'Forgiveness!' said Linton. 'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never think she'll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.' 'And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly. 'No,' he answered. 'It is needless.","As soon as I read this letter, I went to the Lord and told him of his sister's arrival at Wuthering Heights. She wrote me a letter expressing her sorrow at Mrs. Linton's situation and her ardent desire to see him again. She wished him to convey to her a token of my forgiveness as soon as possible. ""Forgive me!"" said Linton. ""I have nothing to forgive her for, Ellen. You can call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and tell her that I am not angry, but sorry to have lost her; especially since I cannot imagine her being happy. A visit to her, however, is out of the question: we are separated forever; and if she really wishes to do me a favor, she should persuade the scoundrel she married to leave the country."" ""And you will not write her a word, sir?"" I asked imploringly. ""No,"" he replied. ""That is superfluous."""
"My communication with Heathcliff's family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!' Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being observed.","My contact with Heathcliff's family will be as rare as with my own. There will be none at all! Mr. Edgar's coldness oppressed me deeply; and all the way from the Grange, I wondered how I could add depth to his words and soften his refusal to offer even a few words of comfort to Isabella. I imagine she had been watching me since morning: I saw her peering through the trellis as I entered the garden and nodded to her; but she shrank back, as if afraid of being seen."
"I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess, that if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.","I entered without knocking. Never before had I seen such a gloomy and sad sight as in this once cheerful house! I must admit that if I were in the young woman's place, I would have at least swept the fireplace and dusted the tables. But she was already contributing to the great disorder that surrounded her."
"Her pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.","Her beautiful face was pale and lifeless; her hair was loose, some strands hanging tangled, others disheveled. She probably hadn't touched her dress since the previous day. Hindley wasn't there."
"Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected letter.","Mr. Heathcliff was sitting at a table, leafing through his purse. When I arrived, he stood up, politely inquired how I was, and offered me a chair. He was the only decent-looking man there, and I thought he had never looked so good. Circumstances had so changed their situation that he would have seemed to me a true gentleman, and his wife a real tramp! She came eagerly forward to greet me and held out her hand for the expected letter."
"I shook my head. She wouldn't understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres, and said - 'If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her.","I shook my head. She didn't understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard. I placed my hat there and muttered something imploring me to give her what I had brought directly. Heathcliff guessed her intention and said, ""If you have anything for Isabella (and I'm sure you do, Nelly), then give it to her."""
"You needn't make a secret of it: we have no secrets between us.' 'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at once. 'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma'am, and his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of keeping it up.' Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions concerning Catherine.","""You needn't make a secret of it: we have no secrets from each other."" ""Oh, I have none,"" I replied, preferring to tell the truth at once. ""My master has instructed me to tell his sister that she needs no letters or visits from him at the moment. He sends you his regards, Madam, and apologizes for the distress you have caused; but he feels that after this time, his household and this household must break off all contact, as it will no longer be possible to maintain it."" Mrs. Heathcliff's lips trembled slightly, and she returned to her seat by the window. Her husband stood beside me on the mantelpiece and began to question me about Catherine."
"I told him as much as I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference with his family, for good or evil. 'Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said; 'she'll never be like she was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense of duty!' 'That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem calm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.","I told him everything I thought about her illness, and under cross-examination, he extracted most of the facts about the cause. I blamed her, as she deserved, for everything going wrong and finally hoped he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid all contact with his family in the future, for better or for worse. ""Mrs. Linton is hardly recovering,"" I told him. ""She will never be the same, but her life has been spared. And if you have any real respect for her, you will never see her again; nay, you will leave this country altogether. And lest you should repent, I tell you that Catherine Linton is now as different from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw as this young lady is from me. Her appearance has changed much, her character even more; and he who is compelled to nurse her can retain her affection in the afterlife only by the memory of what she once was, by simple humanity and a sense of duty!"" ""It's quite possible,"" Heathcliff remarked, trying to appear calm. ""It's quite possible that your master has nothing at his disposal but humanity and a sense of duty."""
"But do you imagine that I shall leave Catherine to his DUTY and HUMANITY? and can you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her: consent, or refuse, I WILL see her! What do you say?' 'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall, through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether.' 'With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be danger of such an event - should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence - why, I think I shall be justified in going to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against him.","But do you think I will leave Catherine to her DUTY and HUMANITY? And can you compare my feelings for Catherine with hers? Before you leave this house, I must make you promise to arrange a meeting with her: whether you agree or not, I will see her! What do you say to that? 'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you cannot; you never will for my sake. Another meeting between you and the gentleman would utterly destroy her.' 'With your help, that can be avoided,' he continued; 'and even if there were the slightest danger of such an event—even if it would add but one more annoyance to her life—well, I believe I have a right to go through with it! I wish you would be so honest as to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from this loss: the fear of her suffering holds me back.' And there you see the difference between our feelings: if he had been in my place and I in his, I would never have attacked him, even if I had hated him with a hatred that would have turned my life to bile."
"You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood! But, till then - if you don't believe me, you don't know me - till then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!' 'And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress.' 'You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said. 'Oh, Nelly! you know she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.","You may appear incredulous if you like! I would never have banished him from her society as long as she wished it. The moment she looked at me, I would have torn out her heart and drunk her blood! But by then—if you don't believe me, you don't know me—by then I would have died inches above her head!—""And yet,"" I interrupted, ""you have no scruple about destroying all hope of a complete cure, by digging into her recollections now that she has almost forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and sorrow.""—""Do you think she has almost forgotten me?"" he said. ""Ah, Nelly! You know! You know as well as I that for every thought she gives to Linton, she gives me a thousand!"" At a very miserable period of my life, I had this thought: it haunted me when I returned to the district last summer; but only its own certainty could induce me to allow that dreadful thought again. And then Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams I once dreamed."
"Two words would comprehend my future - DEATH and HELL: existence, after losing her, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.","Two words would describe my future: DEATH and HELL. After losing her, my life would be hell. But I was foolish to believe for a moment that Edgar Linton's affection was worth more to her than mine. Even if he loved his little creature with all his might, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I do in a single day."
"And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him what he has not?' 'Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,' cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. 'No one has a right to talk in that manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!' 'Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?' observed Heathcliff, scornfully. 'He turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.' 'He is not aware of what I suffer,' she replied. 'I didn't tell him that.' 'You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?' 'To say that I was married, I did write - you saw the note.' 'And nothing since?' 'No.' 'My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,' I remarked. 'Somebody's love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.' 'I should guess it was her own,' said Heathcliff. 'She degenerates into a mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.","And Catherine's heart is as deep as mine: the sea might as well be trapped in this trough as for him to claim all her affection. Phew! He is scarcely dearer to her than her dog or her horse. It is not her way to be loved as I am: how can she love in him what he has not? ""Catherine and Edgar love each other as much as two people can!"" cried Isabel with sudden vigor. ""No one has the right to speak so, and I will not suffer my brother to degrade me in private!"" ""Your brother has a strange attachment for you too, does he not?"" remarked Heathcliff contemptuously. ""He makes you roam the world with surprising passion."" ""He does not know what I suffer,"" she answered. ""I have not told him."" ""Then you have said something to him? You have written to him, have you not?"" ""To say that I am married, I wrote—you have read it."" ""And nothing since?"" ""No."" ""My young wife looks pitiful in her condition,"" I remarked. ""Of course someone is cheating on her. By whom, I suspect; but perhaps I had better not say."" ""I suspect it was her own love,"" said Heathcliff. ""She's becoming a tramp! She's tired of pleasing me so quickly."""
"You'd hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home. However, she'll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice, and I'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.' 'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve. You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must treat her kindly.","You won't believe it, but the very day after our wedding, she was crying because she finally wanted to come home. But she's all the more suited to this house because she's not particularly nice, and I'll make sure she doesn't disgrace me by wandering around. ""Well, sir,"" I replied, ""I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is used to being well cared for and looked after; and that she was raised as an only child and wanted to please everyone. You must give her a maid to keep everything clean, and you must treat her kindly."""
"Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.' 'She abandoned them under a delusion,' he answered; 'picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at last, I think she begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself.","Whatever your opinion of Mr. Edgar, you have no doubt that she possesses a strong capacity for attachment; otherwise, she would not have renounced the elegance, comfort, and friends of her old homeland to settle peacefully with you in such a wilderness. ""She has renounced them out of madness,"" he replied, ""by representing me as a heroine of romance and hoping to gain unlimited favor from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly consider her a rational being, so obstinate is she in forming a fabulous image of me and acting on the false impressions she has entertained. But I think she is finally beginning to know me: I no longer see the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first, nor that foolish inability to recognize that I was serious when I told her my opinion of her infatuation and of herself."""
"It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons could teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you alone for half a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again? I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed.","It was a wonderful trick to discover that I didn't love her. I once believed she could learn nothing! And yet it was ill-learned; for this morning, with terrible intelligence, she announced that I had succeeded in making her hate me! A Herculean task, I assure you! If I succeed, I shall have every reason to thank her. Can I trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I leave you alone for half a day, don't you come back to me sighing and coaxing? I suppose she would have preferred that I radiate only tenderness for you: it wounds her vanity when the truth comes to light."
"But I don't care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for herself.","But I don't care that it becomes known that this passion was only one-sided: and I never lied to her about it. She can't accuse me of deceptive gentleness. The first thing she saw me do upon leaving the manor was hang her little dog; and when she asked me to do it, my first words were a wish to hang up everything that belonged to her, except one thing: perhaps she reserved that exception for herself."
"But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury! Now, was it not the depth of absurdity - of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her? Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing us.","But no insolence disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration for it, if only her dear person were safe! Was it not the height of nonsense, of positive idiocy, that this servile, vile creature could even dream that I could love her? Tell your master, Nelly, that in all my life I have never met such a contemptible creature as herself. She even brings the name of Linton into disrepute; and I have, through lack of ingenuity, departed from my experiments on what she could bear, and yet shrank shamelessly! But tell her also, to reassure her brotherly and masterly heart: I keep strictly within the bounds of the law. Hitherto, I have avoided giving her the slightest right to demand a divorce; and besides, she would thank no one to separate us."
"If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!' 'Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?' 'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's endeavours to make himself detested. 'Don't put faith in a single word he speaks. He's a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being! I've been told I might leave him before; and I've made the attempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine.","If she wanted to leave, she could: the discomfort of his presence outweighed the satisfaction of tormenting her! ""Mr. Heathcliff,"" I said, ""that is the talk of a madman; your wife is most likely convinced you are mad, and has therefore tolerated you until now; but now that you allow her to leave, she will undoubtedly take advantage of the permission. Are you not so bewitched that you wish to remain with him of your own free will?"" ""Beware, Ellen!"" retorted Isabella, her eyes furious; her expression leaving no doubt the success of her partner's self-loathing. ""Don't believe a word he says. He is a lying devil! A monster, not a man! I have been told before that I may leave him; I have tried, but I dare not repeat it!"" But Ellen, promise me that you will not utter a word of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine."
"Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain it - I'll die first! I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!' 'There - that will do for the present!' said Heathcliff. 'If you are called upon in a court of law, you'll remember her language, Nelly! And take a good look at that countenance: she's near the point which would suit me. No; you're not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may be. Go up-stairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in private.","Whatever he says, he means to drive Edgar to despair: he claims he married me on purpose to have power over him; and he won't allow that—I die first! I only hope, I pray, that he will forget his devilish cleverness and kill me! The only pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!—Well, that will do for the present! said Heathcliff. When you are brought to trial, you will recognize his language, Nelly! And look at that face: it is almost as it would suit me. No, you are not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, and I, as your legal guardian, must keep you in my charge, however disagreeable the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean privately."
"That's not the way: up-stairs, I tell you! Why, this is the road upstairs, child!' He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering - 'I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.' 'Do you understand what the word pity means?' I said, hastening to resume my bonnet. 'Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?' 'Put that down!' he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart. 'You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her.","This is no way: upstairs, I tell you! This way, my child! He seized her and pushed her out of the room. And when he came back, he murmured: ""I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I want to tear their entrails out! It is a childish moral disease; and I grind my teeth more and more violently, the greater the pain."" ""Do you understand what the word pity means?"" I asked, hastily putting my hat back on. ""Have you ever felt pity in your life?"" ""Put that down!"" he interrupted, perceiving my intention of going. ""You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must persuade or compel you to help me keep my resolution to see Catherine, and forthwith."" I swear I mean no harm: I do not wish to disturb, annoy, or offend Mr. Linton; I just want to know how she's doing and why she's sick. And I want to ask him if there's anything I can do for her."
"Last night I was in the Grange garden six hours, and I'll return there to-night; and every night I'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.","Last night I spent six hours in the Grange Garden, and I will return there tonight. I will remain there every night and every day until I find an opportunity to enter. Should Edgar Linton encounter me, I will kill him without hesitation and give him enough to ensure his peace during my stay. Should his servants oppose me, I will threaten them with these pistols."
"But wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I'd warn you when I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering mischief.' I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton's tranquillity for his satisfaction. 'The commonest occurrence startles her painfully,' I said. 'She's all nerves, and she couldn't bear the surprise, I'm positive. Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he'll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!' 'In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed Heathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning.","But wouldn't it be better to keep myself away from contact with them or their master? And that would be quite simple. I would warn you upon my arrival, you would discreetly admit me as soon as she was alone, and you would keep watch with a clear conscience until my departure: you would avoid any disorder. I protested against this treacherous role in my employer's house; moreover, I emphasized the cruelty and selfishness of him who disturbed Mrs. Linton's repose for his own amusement. ""The most commonplace occurrences frighten her,"" I said. ""She is nervous, and I am sure she would not bear the surprise. Do not insist, sir! Otherwise, I shall be obliged to inform my master of your intentions; and he will take measures to protect his house and its inhabitants from such intruders!"" ""In that case, I will take measures to protect you, woman!"" cried Heathcliff. ""You must not leave Wuthering Heights until tomorrow morning."""
"It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare her - ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name, and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for her husband.","It's an illusion to pretend Catherine can't bear to see me. And as for surprising her, I don't want to surprise her either: You have to prepare her and ask her if I can come. You say she never mentions my name, and no one ever speaks to her about me. Who is she supposed to talk to if I'm a taboo subject in the house? She thinks you're all spies working for her husband."
"Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you! I guess by her silence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often restless, and anxious- looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You talk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending her from DUTY and HUMANITY! From PITY and CHARITY! He might as well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares? Let us settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no reason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!' Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.","Oh, I don't doubt she's in hell with you! I think it's her silence that most troubles her. You say she's often restless and seems anxious: is that a proof of her tranquility? You speak of her disturbed mind. How could it be otherwise in her dreadful isolation? And this weak, insignificant creature, whom she supports out of DUTY and HUMANITY! Out of COMPASSION and CHARITY! One might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and hope it thrives, as imagine one could revive it from the soil of one's shallow cares? Let me say it at once: will you stay here while I make my way to Catherine about Linton and his servant? Or will you remain my friend as you have been, and do what I ask? Choose! Because there's no reason for me to stay any longer if you persist in your stubborn malice! Well, Mr. Lockwood, I protested, I complained, and I flatly refused fifty times, but finally he forced me to make a deal."
"I engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered Mr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last.","I promised to deliver a letter from him to my mistress. If she would agree, I promised to inform her of Linton's impending absence as soon as he could come, and to return home as soon as possible. I would be out of reach, and my colleagues would be equally unavailable. Was this right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I had averted another crisis by my indulgence; and I also thought it might favorably influence Catherine's madness. Then I remembered Mr. Edgar's severe rebukes regarding my stories; and I endeavored to dispel any misgivings on the matter by repeatedly emphasizing that this breach of confidence, if it deserved so severe a term, would be the last."
"Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand. But here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him how much better you are. My history is DREE, as we say, and will serve to while away another morning.","Nevertheless, my return was even sadder than before; and I had many misgivings before I could bring myself to deliver the letter to Mrs. Linton. But here is Kenneth; I will tell him how much better you are. My story is THIRTEEN, as they say, and it will dispel the worries of tomorrow."
"Dree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse me. But never mind! I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes. I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.","""How sad!"" I thought when the good woman came down to receive the doctor. And she wasn't exactly the person I'd chosen to entertain me with. Well then! I'll get myself a remedy from Mrs. Dean's bitter herbs; and above all, I must beware of the hidden magic in Catherine Heathcliff's radiant eyes. I would fall into a strange trap if I gave in to this young woman and the daughter turned out to be a second version of her mother."
"ANOTHER week over - and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I have now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I'll continue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the whole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her style.","Another week has passed, and I'm getting closer to health and spring! I listened to my neighbor's story in full at several gatherings because it freed up the housekeeper's time for more important tasks. I'll continue in her own words, albeit somewhat abbreviated. She's an excellent storyteller, and I don't think I could do better."
"In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.","That evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew as well as he did that Mr. Heathcliff was nearby; and I didn't go out, as I still had his letter in my pocket and didn't want to be threatened or bothered again. I had decided not to deliver it until my master had left, as I couldn't foresee the consequences for Catherine. Therefore, the letter didn't reach him until three days later."
"The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to church. There was a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went up-stairs.","The fourth day was Sunday, and I brought it to his room after the family had gone to church. A servant had been assigned to guard the house with me, and we were accustomed to locking the doors during services; but this time it was so warm and pleasant that I opened them wide. Knowing who would be there, I told my companion, in order to keep my promise, that the housewife was very keen on oranges and that he must hurry to the village to buy some so he could pay the next day. He left, and I went upstairs."
"Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.","Mrs. Linton sat, as usual, in the open window seat, wearing a flowing white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders. Her long, thick hair, some of which she had torn out at the beginning of her illness, was now combed into natural curls at her temples and neck. Her appearance had changed, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was calm, the change seemed unearthly beautiful."
"The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond - you would have said out of this world. Then, the paleness of her face - its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh - and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened; and - invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should think - refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay. A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.","The flash in her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy, melancholy softness; they no longer gave the impression of gazing at the objects around her: they seemed always to look further, far beyond—one might say, not of this world. The pallor of her face—her haggard look had vanished when she awoke—and the peculiar expression that sprang from her state of mind, though it painfully hinted at its causes, increased the touching interest she excited; and—to me, I know, and to all who saw her, I believe—they always refuted the more tangible signs of recovery and branded her as a person doomed to decay. Before her on the windowsill lay a book, its leaves occasionally stirred by a light breeze."
"I believe Linton had laid it there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.","I think Linton put it this way: She never attempted to divert herself by reading or other pursuits, and he spent hours in retaining her attention on a subject that had once given her pleasure. She was aware of his intentions and, in her better spirits, bore his attempts calmly. Only occasionally did she betray her futility by suppressing a weary sigh and finally repulsing him with a melancholy smile and kisses. Sometimes she would turn away sullenly, bury her face in her hands, or even push him away angrily; and then he carefully left her alone, for he was sure it would do no good."
"Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain.","The bells of Gimmerton Chapel still rang; and the rich, sweet murmur of the stream in the valley was soothing. It was a pleasant substitute for the still-missing rustle of summer leaves, which drowned the music around the Grange when the trees were covered with leaves. At Wuthering Heights, they still rang on calm days after a good thaw or a season of sustained rain."
"And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye. 'There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee. 'You must read it immediately, because it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?' 'Yes,' she answered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it - it was very short. 'Now,' I continued, 'read it.' She drew away her hand, and let it fall.","And Catherine, as she listened, thought of Wuthering Heights—well, when she thought or listened at all; but she had that vague, absent look I spoke of before, which expressed that she perceived material things neither with ear nor with eye. ""Here is a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,"" I said, placing it gently in the hand that rested on her knee. ""You must read it at once, for it demands an answer. Must I break the seal?"" ""Yes,"" she answered, without taking her eyes off it. I opened it—it was very short. ""Now,"" I continued, ""read it."" She withdrew her hand and let it fall again."
"I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at last I resumed - 'Must I read it, ma'am? It is from Mr. Heathcliff.' There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not gathered CHAPTER XV its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness. 'Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an interpreter. 'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall bring.' As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.","I placed it on her lap again and waited for her to look at it for a moment. But the movement was so slow that I finally continued: ""Do you want me to read it, madam? It is from Mr. Heathcliff."" She started, a memory flashed back, and she struggled to collect her thoughts. She lifted the letter and seemed to examine it; and when she came to the signature, she sighed. But I could tell she had not yet grasped the meaning, for when I tried to hear her reply, she only pointed to the name and looked at me with sad, questioning impatience. ""Well, he wants to speak to you,"" I said, assuming she needed an interpreter. ""He is in the garden now, waiting impatiently for my answer."" As I spoke, I saw a large dog lying in the sunlit grass. His ears pricked as if he were about to bark, then he preened his feathers and wagged his tail to announce the approach of someone he didn't consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton leaned forward and listened attentively."
"The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.","A minute later, a footstep sounded in the hall; the open door was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist. Perhaps he sensed that I was tempted to break my promise and therefore decided to trust in his boldness. Catherine stared with strained impatience at the entrance to her room. He didn't go directly into the right room. She beckoned to me to admit him, but he found it before I reached the door, and after a few steps, he was at her side and clasped her in his arms."
"He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there - she was fated, sure to die. 'Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?' was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did not melt. 'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices. 'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me - and thriven on it, I think.","He remained silent and held her for about five minutes. During that time, he kissed more than he had ever kissed before. But my mistress had kissed him first, and I could see that he was so afraid that he found it difficult to look her in the face! He was possessed by the same conviction as I had been from the first moment he saw her: there was no hope of recovery—she was doomed. ""Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! How can I bear this?"" was his first sentence, in a tone that did not conceal his despair. And now he stared at her so intently that I thought his gaze would bring tears to his eyes; but they burned with fear; they did not melt. ""And now?"" said Catherine, leaning back and holding his gaze with a sudden grimace: her mood was only an indication of his ever-changing moods. ""You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!"" And you both regret what you did to me, as if you deserved pity! I won't feel pity for you, not me. You killed me, and I think it still gives you pleasure."
"How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?' Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down. 'I wish I could hold you,' she continued, bitterly, 'till we were both dead! I shouldn't care what you suffered. I care nothing for your sufferings. Why shouldn't you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence, ""That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past.","""How strong you are! How many years do you think you'll live after I'm dead?"" Heathcliff knelt to embrace her; he tried to get up, but she grabbed him by the hair and held him back. ""I wish I could hold you in my arms,"" she continued bitterly, ""until we die! I don't care what you've been through. I'm indifferent to your suffering. Why shouldn't you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I'm buried? In twenty years' time, will you say, 'This is Catherine Earnshaw's grave'? I loved her long ago and was sad to lose her; but that's over."""
"I've loved many others since: my children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not rejoice that I are going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave them!"" Will you say so, Heathcliff?' 'Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,' cried he, wrenching his head free, and grinding his teeth. The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.","I have loved many other people since then: my children are dearer to me than she; and if I die, I shall not be happy to be with her: I shall be sorry to leave her! Is that what you mean, Heathcliff? Don't torture me until I am as mad as you!' he cried, tearing out his head and gnashing his teeth. 'These two presented a strange and terrifying picture to an unbiased observer. Catherine might justly think that heaven would be a land of exile for her if she did not lay aside her morals along with her mortal body."
"Her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin. 'Are you possessed with a devil,' he pursued, savagely, 'to talk in that manner to me when you are dying? Do CHAPTER XV you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?' 'I shall not be at peace,' moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more kindly 'I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.","Her face shone with fierce vengeance, on her white cheeks, her bloodless lips, and her sparkling eyes; and she held with closed fingers a lock of hair she had grasped. Her companion, on the other hand, had, while rising with one hand, grasped her arm with the other; and his gentleness was so unsuited to the requirements of his condition that, when he released her, I saw four distinct marks on his pale skin. ""Are you possessed by a demon,"" he continued angrily, ""that you speak to me thus as you die? Do you think all these words will be engraved in my memory and persist forever after your death? You know you lie when you say I killed you; and, Catherine, you know I can forget you as well as my existence! Is it not enough for your infernal selfishness that I writhe in the torments of hell while you rest in peace?"" ""I will find no rest,"" groaned Catherine, weakened by the violent and irregular beating of her heart, which pounded visibly and audibly in her excitement. She remained silent until the crisis was over; then she continued more gently: ""I wish you no greater torment than I have, Heathcliff."""
"I only wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember than my harsh words! Won't you come here again? Do!' Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.","I only wish that we shall never be separated again. And if after this, a word from me still pains you, remember that I feel the same pain deep down, and forgive me! Come here and kneel again! You have never hurt me in your life. No, if you still harbor anger, the memory will be worse than my harsh words! Will you not come back? Do it! Heathcliff sank into his chair and leaned forward, but not far enough to see her face, which was deathly pale with emotion. She bent down to look at him; he would not allow it: he turned abruptly and went to the fireplace, where he remained silent with his back to us."
"Mrs. Linton's glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:'Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave. THAT is how I'm loved! Well, never mind.","Mrs. Linton's gaze followed him suspiciously; every movement aroused a new feeling in her. After a pause and a long look, she continued, turning to me with indignant disappointment: ""Oh, you see, Nelly, he wouldn't hesitate for a moment to rescue me from the grave. That's how I'm loved! Never mind."""
"That is not MY Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he's in my soul. And,' added she musingly, 'the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all.","He is not MY Heathcliff. I will always love mine and carry him within me: He is in my soul. And, she added thoughtfully, what annoys me most is this broken prison."
"I'm tired of being enclosed here. I'm wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are sorry for me - very soon that will be altered.","I'm tired of being locked up here. I'm tired of escaping into this wonderful world, of always being in it: not to see it through tears or long for it through the walls of grief, but to truly be in it, to be in it. Nelly, you think you're better and happier than me, in the best of health and in the best of shape: you pity me, that will soon change."
"I shall be sorry for YOU. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I WONDER he won't be near me!' She went on to herself. 'I thought he wished it.","""I'll take pity on you. I'll be incomparably superior to all of you. I wonder why he doesn't want to be near me!"" she continued murmuring. ""I thought he wished."""
"Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to me, Heathcliff.' In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate.","Heathcliff, my dear! Don't be so sad now. Come to me, Heathcliff."" In her haste, she stood up and leaned on the arm of the chair. After this fervent prayer, he turned to her with a despairing look."
"His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.","His eyes, wide-open and moist, finally cast a fierce glance at her; his chest heaved convulsively. For an instant their eyes met, then I scarcely saw it, but suddenly Catherine sat up and seized her, and they embraced in an embrace from which my mistress, I believed, would never emerge alive; indeed, she seemed to me instantly unconscious. He threw himself onto the nearest chair, and when I hurried over to see if she had fainted, he gritted his teeth, foamed like a mad dog, and drew her to him with greedy jealousy."
"I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity. A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly 'You teach me now how cruel you've been - cruel and false. WHY did you despise me? WHY did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort.","I felt uneasy in the company of a being of my own kind: he didn't seem to understand me, even though I spoke to him; so I drew back and remained silent, deeply perplexed. A movement from Catherine gave me a moment of relief: she raised her hand to take him by the neck and press her cheek against his, while he held her fast; while he, in turn, showered her with wild caresses and said in a wild voice: ""Now show me how cruel, how cruel, how deceitful you have been. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have no words to console you."""
"You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight you - they'll damn you.","You deserve this. You killed yourself. Yes, you can kiss me and cry; but take my kisses and my tears away from me: they will ruin you, they will damn you."
"You loved me then what RIGHT had you to leave me? What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, YOU, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart - YOU have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong.","You loved me then, what right had you to leave me? What right, tell me, did you have to harbor this miserable fantasy for Linton? For neither misery, nor humiliation, nor death, nor anything else that God or Satan could have inflicted on us, did you do of your own free will. I did not break your heart, you broke it; and in breaking it, you broke mine. So much the worse for me, for I am strong."
"Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - oh, God! would YOU like to live with your soul in the grave?' CHAPTER XV 'Let me alone. Let me alone,' sobbed Catherine. 'If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won't upbraid you! I forgive you.","Do I want to live? What kind of life will it be if you—oh God!—want to live with your soul in the grave? CHAPTER 15 ""Leave me alone. Leave me alone,"" sobbed Catherine. ""If I have done wrong, I will die of it. That is enough! You, too, have abandoned me: but I will not reproach you! I forgive you."""
"Forgive me!' 'It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands,' he answered. 'Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love MY murderer - but YOURS! How can I?' They were silent-their faces hid against each other, and washed by each other's tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.","""Forgive me!"" ""It is hard to forgive, to look into those eyes, to feel those withered hands,"" he replied. ""Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes! I forgive you for what you did to me. I love MY murderer, but yours! How could I?"" They were silent, their faces buried in tears. At least, I suspect the tears came from both sides; it seemed as if Heathcliff was crying on such an important occasion."
"I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away, the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch. 'Service is over,' I announced. 'My master will be here in half an hour.' Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never moved. Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer. 'Now he is here,' I exclaimed. 'For heaven's sake, hurry down! You'll not meet any one on the front stairs.","By now, I was feeling rather ill; the afternoon was passing quickly, the man I had dismissed was returning from his errand, and in the light of the setting sun over the valley floor, I could make out a crowd gathered outside the porch of Gimmerton Chapel. ""Service is over,"" I announced. ""My master will be here in half an hour."" Heathcliff groaned and cursed and drew Catherine closer; she didn't move for a moment. Suddenly, I saw a group of servants coming up the street to the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was close behind me; he opened the gate himself and walked slowly upstairs, probably enjoying this beautiful afternoon with its sweet summer breeze. ""He's here!"" I cried. ""For goodness' sake, come down quickly! You won't find anyone on the main staircase."""
"Do be quick; and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.' 'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from his companion's arms. 'But if I live, I'll see you again before you are asleep. I won't stray five yards from your window.' 'You must not go!' she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength allowed. 'You SHALL not, I tell you.' 'For one hour,' he pleaded earnestly. 'Not for one minute,' she replied. 'I MUST - Linton will be up immediately,' persisted the alarmed intruder. He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act - she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in her face. 'No!' she shrieked. 'Oh, don't, don't go.","""Quick, stay among the trees until he comes."" ""I must go, Cathy,"" said Heathcliff, trying to wriggle out of his companion's arms. ""But if I survive, I'll see you again before you fall asleep. I won't go five meters from your window."" ""You mustn't go!"" she answered, holding him as tightly as her strength allowed. ""You mustn't, I tell you."" ""For an hour,"" he implored her. ""Not a minute,"" she answered. ""I MUST—Linton will get up at once,"" insisted the surprised intruder. He would have risen and freed her fingers with that gesture; she clung to him, panting: fierce determination was written all over her face. ""No!"" she shrieked. ""Oh, don't go, don't go."""
"It is the last time! Edgar will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!' 'Damn the fool! There he is,' cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat. 'Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I'll stay. If he shot me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.' And there they were fast again.","This is the last time! Edgar won't hurt us. Heathcliff, I'm dying! I'm dying! ""Good heavens, you fool! There he is!"" cried Heathcliff, sinking back in his chair. ""Shh, my darling! Shh, shh, Catherine! I'm staying. If he shot me like that, I'd die with a blessing on my lips."" And they left quickly."
"I heard my master mounting the stairs - the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified. 'Are you going to listen to her ravings?' I said, passionately. 'She does not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most diabolical deed that ever you did.","I heard my master coming up the stairs; cold sweat stood on my forehead: I was horrified. ""Do you want to listen to her babble?"" I asked passionately. ""She doesn't know what she's saying. Do you want to ruin her just because she isn't intelligent enough to defend herself? Stand up! You could be free immediately. This is the most diabolical act you have ever committed."""
"We are all done for - master, mistress, and servant.' CHAPTER XV I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down. 'She's fainted, or dead,' I thought: 'so much the better. Far better that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about her.' Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.","""We are all ready: master, mistress, and servant."" CHAPTER XV I wrung my hands and shouted; and Mr. Linton quickened his pace at the noise. In the midst of my excitement, I was sincerely glad to see Catherine's arms slacken and her head hang down. ""She is either weak or dead,"" I thought, ""so much the better. Better dead than to become a burden and source of misery to all around her."" Edgar rushed upon his unexpected guest, pale with surprise and anger."
"What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless- looking form in his arms. 'Look there!' he said. 'Unless you be a fiend, help her first - then you shall speak to me!' He walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend.","What he intended, I don't know; but the other immediately put an end to all the demonstrations by taking the lifeless figure in his arms. ""Look!"" he said. ""If you are not a demon, help her first, then you will speak to me!"" He went into the living room and sat down. Mr. Linton called me, and with much effort and trial, we succeeded in bringing her to her senses; but she was completely bewildered; she sighed and groaned and recognized no one. Edgar, in his concern for her, forgot his hated friend."
"I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night. 'I shall not refuse to go out of doors,' he answered; 'but I shall stay in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall be under those larch-trees.","I didn't. I went there as quickly as possible and begged him to leave. I assured him that Catherine was feeling better and that he would hear from me in the morning about his night. ""I won't refuse to go out,"" he replied, ""but I'll stay in the garden. And Nelly, keep your word tomorrow. I'll be under those larches."""
"Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be in or not.' He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and, ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house of his luckless presence. ABOUT twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter's distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.","""Look! Or I'll return, whether Linton is here or not."" He cast a quick glance through the half-open chamber door, and, after assuring himself that what I had just said was evidently true, left the house of his unfortunate presence. About midnight that night, the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights was born: a little baby of seven months; two hours after her mother's death, without having sufficiently recovered consciousness to miss Heathcliff or recognize Edgar. The latter's bewilderment at his loss is too painful a subject to enlarge upon; the aftermath showed how deeply grief had overwhelmed him."
"A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's. An unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life, and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.","A great advantage, in my eyes, was that he had no heir. I felt sorry for him as I looked at the frail orphan and inwardly cursed old Linton for (out of pure partiality) leaving his fortune to his daughter instead of his son. He was an unwanted baby, poor thing! He could have lost his life, and no one cared about it in those first hours of his life."
"We redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be. Next morning - bright and cheerful out of doors - stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, and his eyes shut.","We made up for this omission later; but the beginning was as hostile as the end was likely to be. The next morning, it was fine and bright outside, and a soft light filtered through the blinds of the quiet room, bathing the sofa and the person sitting on it in a soft, delicate glow. Edgar Linton had laid his head on the pillow and closed his eyes."
"His young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but HIS was the hush of exhausted anguish, and HERS of perfect peace. Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared. And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.","Her young, beautiful features seemed almost as lifeless as those of the person beside him; yet HE was the stillness of exhausted fear and HIS perfect peace. Her smooth brow, her closed eyelids, her lips expressing a smile—no angel in heaven could have been more beautiful than she appeared. And I shared the infinite silence in which she rested: never was my spirit holier than when contemplating this carefree image of divine repose."
"I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before: 'Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth or now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!' I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter - the Eternity they have entered - where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at last.","Instinctively, I repeated the words she had spoken a few hours before: ""Incomparably above us all! Whether she be on earth or in heaven, her spirit is at peace with God!"" I don't know if it's a trait of mine, but I am seldom anything but happy when I stand watch in the death chamber, when no mourner, despairing or despairing, shares that duty with me. I see there a peace that neither earth nor hell can break, and feel the certainty of an endless and shadowless beyond—the eternity they have entered—where life is boundless, love compassionate, and joy in its fullness. I remarked then how much selfishness there is even in a love such as Mr. Linton's, when he so lamented Catherine's blessed release! After her capricious and impatient life, one might have doubted whether she had finally deserved an oasis of repose."
"One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant. Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir? I'd give a great deal to know.","In moments of serene contemplation, one might have doubts, but not in the presence of his body. He radiated a calm that seemed to promise the same peace as his former inhabitant. Do you think such people are happy in the afterlife, sir? I would give anything to know."
"I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something heterodox. She proceeded: Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to think she is; but we'll leave her with her Maker. The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.","I declined to answer Mrs. Dean's question, as it seemed rather unorthodox to me. She continued, ""I fear we have no right to believe she is following in the footsteps of Catherine Linton; but we leave her to her Creator."" The Lord seemed to be asleep, and shortly after sunrise I ventured out of the room into the pure, refreshing air."
"The servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right within.","The servants thought I had come to shake off the fatigue of my long night's vigil; in reality, my main motive was to see Mr. Heathcliff. Had he remained under the larches all night, he would not have heard the commotion in the Grange, unless he had seen the messenger galloping to Gimmerton. Had he come closer, he would probably have noticed from the flickering lights and the sound of the outer doors opening and closing that all was not well within."
"I wished, yet feared, to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but how to do it I did not know. He was there - at least, a few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell pattering round him.","I was burning to find him, but also afraid. I felt the terrible news had to be delivered to me, and I could hardly wait to process it. But how, I didn't know. He was there, at least a few meters away, in the park. He was leaning against an old ash tree, his hat off, his hair wet with the dew that had collected on the budding branches and crackled around him."
"He had been standing a long time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:- 'She's dead!' he said; 'I've not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away - don't snivel before me.","He had been there for quite a while, because I saw a couple of donkeys flying barely a meter away, busy building their nests, paying no more attention to their proximity than to a piece of wood. As I approached, they flew away, and he opened his eyes and said, ""She's dead!"" he said. ""I didn't wait for you to know. Put your handkerchief away and don't cry in front of me."""
"Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!' I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I first looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground. 'Yes, she's dead!' I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks. 'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!' 'Did SHE take due warning, then?' asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer. 'Did she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the event. How did - ?' He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony, defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare. 'How did she die?' he resumed, at last - fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends. 'Poor wretch!' I thought; 'you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride cannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of humiliation.' 'Quietly as a lamb!' I answered, aloud. 'She drew a sigh, and stretched herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!' 'And - did she ever mention me?' he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear. 'Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left her,' I said. 'She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.","Good heavens! She won't give you any tears! I wept as much for him as for her: sometimes one feels sorry for creatures who have no compassion for themselves or others. When I first looked into his face, I saw that he had heard of the catastrophe; and the wild thought came to me that his heart was softened and he was praying, for his lips were moving and his eyes were fixed on the ground. ""Yes, she is dead!"" I answered, stifling my sobs and wiping my cheeks. ""Gone to Heaven, I hope; where we may all go to her if we heed the necessary warnings and give up our wicked ways to follow what is right!"" ""Did SHE heed the necessary warnings?"" asked Heathcliff, attempting a mocking look. ""Did she die a saint? Come, tell me the truth of the event. What—?"" He tried to pronounce the name, but could not; And he pressed his lips together, silently fighting his inner pain, while defying my pity with a grim and fearless look. ""How did she die?"" he finally asked, despite his boldness, eager for support; for after this struggle, in spite of everything, he trembled to his fingertips. ""Poor fellow!"" I thought. ""You have the same heart and nerves as your fellow men! Why should you hide them? Your pride cannot blind God! You tempt him to wrest them from you until he utters a cry of humiliation."" ""Silent as a lamb!"" I answered aloud. ""She sighed and stretched like a child waking and falling asleep again; and five minutes later I felt a slight throbbing in her heart, and nothing more!"" ""And... did she ever speak of me?"" he asked hesitantly, as if afraid the answer might reveal details he could not bear to reveal. ""She never regained her senses. Since you left her, she hasn't recognized anyone,"" I said. ""She lies there with a sweet smile, and her last thoughts are of her beautiful childhood years."""
"Her life closed in a gentle dream - may she wake as kindly in the other world!' 'May she wake in torment!' he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion. 'Why, she's a liar to the end! Where is she? Not THERE - not in heaven not perished - where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my sufferings! And I pray one prayer - I repeat it till my tongue stiffens - Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you - haunt me, then! The murdered DO haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts HAVE wandered on earth. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! only DO not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I CANNOT live without my life! I CANNOT live without my soul!' He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.","Her life ended in a sweet dream—may she wake as sweetly in the hereafter!—May she wake in agony! he cried with horrible violence, stamping his feet and groaning in a sudden fit of uncontrollable passion. “Well, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not THERE—not in Heaven, not in dying—where? Oh! You said you didn’t care about my suffering! And I say a prayer—I repeat it until my tongue is stiff: Catherine Earnshaw, may you have no rest while I live; you said I murdered you—so haunt me! The murdered haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that spirits have walked the earth. Be with me always—assume any shape—drive me mad!” Only don’t leave me in that abyss where I cannot find you! Oh, my God! It is unspeakable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!’ He beat his head against the gnarled trunk, looked up, and howled, not like a human being, but like a wild animal being hunted to death with knives and spears."
"I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night. It hardly moved my compassion - it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.","I saw several bloodstains on the tree bark, as well as on his hand and forehead. The scene I witnessed was probably a repeat of those that had unfolded during the night. It barely affected me; it astonished me. Still, I hesitated to leave him like that. But as soon as he recovered enough to notice my observation, he barked the order to depart, and I obeyed."
"He was beyond my skill to quiet or console! Mrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing- room. Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and - a circumstance concealed from all but me - Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication with him: still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu.","It was impossible for me to console or reassure him! Mrs. Linton's funeral was to take place on the Friday following her death; and until then, her coffin lay uncovered, strewn with flowers and fragrant leaves, in the great drawing-room. Linton spent his days and nights there like a sleepless watchdog; and—what I revealed only to myself—Heathcliff at least spent his nights outside and, likewise, had no desire for rest. I had no contact with him, but knew of his intention of coming in when he could; and on Tuesday, shortly after sunset, when my master, from fatigue, had to go home for a few hours, I went and opened a window, as he insisted on giving him the opportunity to bid a last farewell to the faded image of his idol."
"He did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise. Indeed, I shouldn't have discovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own.","He didn't miss the opportunity, cautious and brief; too cautious to betray his presence at the slightest noise. In fact, I wouldn't have noticed him if the curtain around the corpse's face hadn't hung askew and I hadn't seen a lock of pale hair on the floor, tied with a silver thread. On closer inspection, it turned out to be from a locket that hung around Catherine's neck. Heathcliff had opened the locket, emptied its contents, and replaced it with a black lock of his own."
"I twisted the two, and enclosed them together. Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants. Isabella was not asked.","I confused the two. Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to bury his sister's remains. He didn't apologize, but he never came. Therefore, apart from her husband, the audience consisted entirely of tenants and servants. Isabella wasn't invited."
"The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of her own relations, outside. It was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost buries it. Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the graves.","To the villagers' surprise, Catherine's grave was neither in the chapel beneath the carved Linton monument nor near the graves of her relatives outside. The grave was dug on a grassy slope in a corner of the cemetery, where the wall is so low that heather and bilberries have overgrown it; sphagnum moss covers it almost completely. Her husband now lies in the same spot; both have a simple headstone above them and a plain gray block at their feet to mark their graves."
"THAT Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north- east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.","This Friday was our last nice day in a month. In the evening, the weather changed: the wind shifted from south to northeast, bringing rain, then sleet and snow. The next day, it was hard to believe that summer had already lasted three weeks: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under winter snowdrifts; the larks were silent, and the young leaves of the first trees were blackened by the fire."
"And dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the maids, and I cried - 'Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here; What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?' 'Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice; 'but I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot stop myself.' With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her hand to her side. 'I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!' she continued, after a pause; 'except where I've flown. I couldn't count the number of falls I've had.","And that morning dawned dark, cold, and gloomy! My master kept his room; I took possession of the solitary parlor and converted it into a nursery. I was sitting there with a whimpering doll on my lap, rocking it back and forth, and watching the flakes still fly through the curtainless window, when the door opened and someone came in, gasping and laughing! My anger was for a moment greater than my surprise. I thought it was one of the maids and cried, ""Ready! How dare you show your thoughtlessness here? What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?"" ""Excuse me!"" answered a familiar voice; ""but I know Edgar is in bed, and there's nothing I can do about it."" Then the speaker came panting towards me with her hand at her side. ""I ran all the way from Wuthering Heights!"" she continued after a pause; ""except where I flew."" I couldn't count how many times I fell."
"Oh, I'm aching all over! Don't be alarmed! There shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.' The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her. 'My dear young lady,' I exclaimed, 'I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to- night, so it is needless to order the carriage.' 'Certainly I shall,' she said; 'walking or riding: yet I've no objection to dress myself decently.","Oh, I hurt all over! Don't panic! I'll explain as soon as possible. Just go downstairs, order the carriage to Gimmerton, and ask a servant to fetch some clothes from my wardrobe. The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She didn't look at all like she was having a fit of laughter: her hair was flowing over her shoulders from snow and water; she was wearing her usual girl's dress, which was more in keeping with her age than her condition: a low-cut, short-sleeved gown with no head or neck. The dress was made of light silk and clung to her body when wet, and her feet were protected only by thin slippers. Added to this was a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold kept from bleeding profusely, a pale face covered with scratches and bruises, and a body that could barely stand from exhaustion. You can imagine that my initial shock didn't subside much once I had time to examine her. ""My dear young lady,"" I cried, ""I'm not going anywhere and I won't hear from you until you've taken off all your clothes and put on dry ones. And you certainly won't be going to Gimmerton tonight, so there's no point in ordering a carriage."" ""I certainly will,"" she said, ""on foot or on horseback; but I don't mind dressing decently."""
"And - ah, see how it flows down my neck now! The fire does make it smart.' She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments. 'Now, Ellen,' she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, 'you sit down opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't like to see it! You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly - yes, more than any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I sha'n't forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise with him - the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker! This is the last thing of his I have about me:' she slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. 'I'll smash it!' she continued, striking it with childish spite, 'and then I'll burn it!' and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals. 'There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again.","And—ah, look how it's running down my throat now! The fire really hurts me.” She insisted on following her instructions before allowing me to touch her; and only after the coachman had dressed and a maid had packed the necessary clothes did I receive her permission to dress the wound and help her change. “Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was completed and she was sitting in an armchair by the fire with a cup of tea before her, “sit opposite me and dress Catherine's baby: I don't like to see it! You mustn't think I care for Catherine just because I was foolish enough to come in: I wept bitterly too—yes, more than anyone has cause to weep. We parted irreconcilably, you remember, and I won't forgive myself.” But still, I had no pity for him—that beast! Oh, give me the poker! It's all I have left of him!” She took the gold ring off her ring finger and threw it on the ground. ""I'm going to break it!"" she continued, hitting it with childish malice, ""and then I'm going to burn it!"" And she picked up the abused object and threw it into the embers. ""Look! He'll definitely buy me a new one when he gets me back."""
"He'd be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he? And I won't come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed - of that incarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It's a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!' 'Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!' I interrupted; 'you'll disorder the handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.","He might come for me and annoy Edgar. I dare not stay for fear the thought might put him into his evil head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind to me, has he? And I did not come to ask his help; and I shall not give him any more trouble. I had to seek refuge here; but if I had not known that he was avoiding me, I would have gone into the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, if you had brought me what I needed, and returned to a place beyond the reach of my accursed—that very goblin! Oh, he was so angry! If he had caught me! It is a pity that Earnshaw is no match for him in strength: I would not have run away until I had seen him almost destroyed, if Hindley could have done it! ""Come now, don't talk so fast, miss!"" I interrupted. “Otherwise you’ll tangle the handkerchief I tied around your face, and the wound will start bleeding again.”"
"Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!' 'An undeniable truth,' she replied. 'Listen to that child! It maintains a constant wail - send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha'n't stay any longer.' I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with us. 'I ought, and I wished to remain,' answered she, 'to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right home. But I tell you he wouldn't let me! Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry - could bear to think that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away.","Drink your tea, take a deep breath, and forget laughing: laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition! ""Undeniable truth!"" she replied. ""Listen to the child! It cries incessantly; keep it away from me for an hour; I won't stay any longer."" I rang the bell and entrusted it to a servant; then I asked her why she had fled Wuthering Heights in this unlikely situation and where she intended to go, since she refused to stay with us. ""I had to stay, and I really wanted to stay,"" she replied, ""to cheer Edgar up and look after the baby, for two reasons, and because the Grange is my rightful home. But I tell you, he wouldn't let me! Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and cheerful? Bear to see us quiet and not anxious to poison our comforts?"" Now I have the satisfaction of knowing for certain that he hates me, so much so that it annoys him deeply to have me within earshot or sight. I notice that whenever I approach him, his face involuntarily twists into an expression of hatred; partly because he knows I have good reasons for it, partly from a primal dislike. This hatred is strong enough to convince me that he would not pursue me across England, provided I found a safe exit; so I must run away."
"I've recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I'd rather he'd kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I'm at my ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if - no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well.","I've overcome my initial desire to be killed by him: I would have preferred him to kill himself! He has indeed destroyed my love, and that reassures me. I still remember how much I loved him; and I vaguely imagine that perhaps I would still love him if... no, no! Even if he had loved me, his diabolical nature would have revealed itself one way or another. Catherine had terribly perverse tastes to value him so highly because she knew him so well."
"Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!' 'Hush, hush! He's a human being,' I said. 'Be more charitable: there are worse men than he is yet!' 'He's not a human being,' she retorted; 'and he has no claim on my charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!' And here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced. 'You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.","Monstrous! I wish he were erased from creation and from my memory! ""Shh! He's a man,"" I said. ""Be a little gentler: there are worse men than he!"" ""He's not a man,"" she replied, ""and he has no claim to my mercy. I gave him my heart, and he took it, crushed it, and threw it back to me. One feels for the heart, Ellen, and since he destroyed mine, I can feel no pity for him. And I wouldn't, even if he moaned and wept tears of blood for Catherine until his death! No, truly, truly, I wouldn't!"" And here Isabella began to weep; but she immediately wiped the water from her eyelashes and began again. ""You asked me what finally made me run away?"" I felt compelled to try, for I had succeeded in inflaming his anger more strongly than his malice."
"Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of selfpreservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge. 'Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral.","Tearing nerves with red-hot tongs requires more self-control than hitting someone on the head. He was so angry that he forgot the devilish cleverness he boasted about and resorted to murderous violence. I took pleasure in annoying him: this pleasure aroused my instinct for self-preservation, so I freed myself; and should I ever fall into his hands again, he is entitled to terrible revenge. ""Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been present at the funeral."""
"He kept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls. 'Heathcliff - I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house from last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.","He remained sober, indeed, perfectly sober: he did not go to bed drunk at six o'clock, nor rise drunk at midnight. He therefore rose in a suicidal and sullen mood, as if ready to go to church or to a dance; instead, he sat by the fire and drank glasses of gin or brandy. ""Heathcliff! The name makes me shudder!"" was a stranger in the house from last Sunday until today. Whether it was the angels who fed him, or his family with them, I do not know; but he has not eaten with us for nearly a week."
"He has just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his chamber; looking himself in - as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding these precious orisons - and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat - he would be off again; always straight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday. 'I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph's eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn't think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions. I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with ""t' little maister"" and his staunch supporter, that odious old man! When Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements.","He came home just at sunrise and went up to his room, where he contemplated himself—as if someone were dreaming of desiring his company! There he continued to pray like a Methodist: only the deity he invoked was nothing more than insignificant dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was strangely taken for his own black father! After he had finished these precious prayers—and they usually lasted until he grew hoarse and his voice caught in his throat—he set out again, always straight to the Grange! I wonder if Edgar hadn't sent a policeman to arrest him! Much as I mourned for Catherine, it was impossible for me not to consider this time of freedom from humiliating oppression a holiday. I gathered enough courage to endure Joseph's endless sermons without tears and to walk about the house less often with the feet of a terrified thief. You wouldn't think I burst into tears at the slightest word Joseph utters; but he and Hareton are disgusting company. I'd rather sit with Hindley and listen to his dreadful prattle than with 'the little master' and his faithful follower, that dreadful old man! When Heathcliff is at home, I often have to take refuge in the kitchen and its company, or starve in the damp, uninhabited rooms; when he is not there, as has been the case this week, I put a table and chair in a corner by the fire, without taking the trouble to look for Mr. Earnshaw; and he never disturbs my engagements."
"He is quieter now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he's sure he's an altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ""so as by fire."" I'm puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business. 'Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go up-stairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirk-yard and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.","He is calmer now than before, unless provoked: gloomy and more depressed and less angry. Joseph confirms that he is certain he has changed: the Lord has touched his heart, and he has been saved ""as through fire."" I am surprised to see signs of positive change, but that is not my concern. ""Last night I sat in my corner late into the night reading old books. The walk upstairs was so sad while the snow swirled outside, and my thoughts kept returning to the cemetery and the freshly dug grave! I hardly dared to take my eyes off the page; that melancholy scene immediately took its place."""
"Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.","Hindley sat opposite him, his head in his hand, perhaps thinking the same thing. He had stopped drinking when it had become almost irrational and hadn't moved or spoken for two or three hours. Not a sound could be heard in the house except the howling of the wind occasionally rattling the windows, the faint crackle of the embers, and the click of my candle scissors as I occasionally pulled the long wick from the candle."
"Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be restored. 'The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get in by the other.","Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad. As I read, I sighed, for it seemed to me that all joy had vanished from the world and would never return. The gloomy silence was finally broken by the sound of the kitchen door opening: Heathcliff had returned home from his watch earlier than usual, probably because of the sudden thunderstorm. That entrance was barred, and we heard him enter through the other."
"I rose with an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at me. '""I'll keep him out five minutes,"" he exclaimed. ""You won't object?"" '""No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,"" I answered. ""Do! put the key in the look, and draw the bolts."" 'Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn't exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak. '""You, and I,"" he said, ""have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?"" '""I'm weary of enduring now,"" I replied; ""and I'd be glad of a retaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies."" '""Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!"" cried Hindley. ""Mrs. Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing; but sit still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I'm sure you would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend's existence; he'll be YOUR death unless you overreach him; and he'll be MY ruin.","I rose with the irresistible expression of what I felt on my lips, whereupon my companion, who had been staring at the door, turned to me. ""I'll detain him for five minutes,"" he cried. ""Do you mind?"" ""No, you can detain him all night,"" I replied. ""Do it! Put the key in the door and draw the bolts."" Earnshaw obeyed before his guest reached the entrance; then he came over, placed his chair on the other side of my table, leaned over it, and searched my eyes for a trace of sympathy for the burning hatred that emanated from him. Looking and feeling like a murderer, he did not quite find it; but he did find enough to encourage him to speak. ""You and I,"" he said, ""are both in this man's debt!"" If we were not cowards, we could pay together. Are you as weak as your brother? Are you willing to endure to the end without doing anything for it?' 'I am tired of suffering,' I replied, 'and would be glad of a revenge that does not rebound upon me; but treason and violence are double-ended spears; they wound those who seize them more than their enemies.' 'Treason and violence are a just revenge for treason and violence!' cried Hindley. 'Mrs. Heathcliff, I beg you to do nothing but be still and quiet. Tell me now, can you tell me? I am sure you would be as glad as I am to witness the end of the Devil's existence; he will cause your death if you do not defeat him, and he will cause MY ruin.'"
"Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock strikes - it wants three minutes of one - you're a free woman!"" 'He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away, however, and seized his arm. '""I'll not hold my tongue!"" I said; ""you mustn't touch him. Let the door remain shut, and be quiet!"" '""No! I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!"" cried the desperate being. ""I'll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and Hareton justice! And you needn't trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone.","Cursed be that devilish villain! He's knocking on the door as if he were already in charge! Promise me you'll be quiet, and before the clock strikes—which will be in three minutes—you'll be a free woman! He took the tool I described in my letter from his chest and was about to extinguish the candle. But I snatched it from his hand and grabbed his arm. ""I won't be silent!"" I said. ""You mustn't touch it. Close the door and be quiet!"" ""No! I've made my decision, and by God, I'll carry it out!"" cried the desperate creature. ""I'll do you a favor after all and bring justice for Hareton! And you needn't worry about my protection; Catherine is dead."""
"Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this minute - and it's time to make an end!"" 'I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him. '""You'd better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!"" I exclaimed, in rather a triumphant tone. ""Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you persist in endeavouring to enter."" '""You'd better open the door, you - "" he answered, addressing me by some elegant term that I don't care to repeat. '""I shall not meddle in the matter,"" I retorted again. ""Come in and get shot, if you please. I've done my duty."" 'With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him.","No one would regret or be ashamed of me, even if I had slit my throat—and it's time to put an end to that! I might as well have been fighting a bear or talking to a madman. I had no choice but to rush to a gate and warn the victim of the fate that awaited them. ""Better seek refuge elsewhere tonight!"" I cried triumphantly. ""Mr. Earnshaw intends to shoot you if you continue to try to break in."" ""You'd better open the door, you—"" he retorted with an elegant formula that I'd rather not repeat. ""I'm not interfering,"" I replied. ""Go in and be shot if you want. I've done my duty."" With that, I closed the window and returned to my place by the fire, too little hypocrisy to show the slightest concern at the impending danger."
"Earnshaw swore passionately at me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for HIM should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing for ME should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security.","Earnshaw scolded me passionately: he protested that I had always loved the villain, and reproved me for my base disposition. And deep in my heart (and my conscience never reproached me) I thought what a blessing it would be to him if Heathcliff would relieve him of his sufferings; and what a blessing to me if he would send him home! While I was pondering these thoughts, the window behind me burst beneath the villain's blow, and his black face gleamed through with devastating force. The jambs were too close for his shoulders to follow them, and I smiled, pleased with my imagined safety."
"His hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark. '""Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!"" he ""girned,"" as Joseph calls it. '""I cannot commit murder,"" I replied. ""Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol."" '""Let me in by the kitchen door,"" he said. '""Hindley will be there before me,"" I answered: ""and that's a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can't imagine how you think of surviving her loss."" '""He's there, is he?"" exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. ""If I can get my arm out I can hit him!"" 'I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you don't know all, so don't judge. I wouldn't have aided or abetted an attempt on even HIS life for anything.","His hair and clothes were snow-white, and his sharp, cannibalistic teeth, revealing cold and rage, gleamed in the darkness. ""Isabella, let me in, or I'll change your mind!"" he grinned, as Joseph says. ""I can't commit murder,"" I replied. ""Mr. Hindley is standing guard with a knife and a loaded pistol."" ""Take me in through the kitchen door,"" he said. ""Hindley will be there for me,"" I replied, ""and what a poor darling, that yours can't stand a blizzard! We used to stay in bed alone while the summer moon shone, but as soon as a winter storm returns, we must run for cover! Heathcliff, if I were you, I would lie down on his grave and die like a faithful dog. Isn't the world worth living in now?"" You've made it clear to me that Catherine was the only joy in your life: I can't imagine how you intend to cope with her loss."" ""He's here, isn't he?"" my companion shouted, running toward the opening. ""If I can get my arm out, I can beat him!"" ""I'm afraid, Ellen, you're portraying me as a truly bad person; but you don't know everything, so don't judge me. For nothing in the world would I have supported or encouraged an attempt on his life."""
"Wish that he were dead, I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw's weapon and wrenched it from his grasp. 'The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its owner's wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang in.","I wished him dead, I had to. And I was deeply disappointed and dismayed by the consequences of my mockery when he lunged at Earnshaw's weapon and snatched it from his hand. The charge exploded, and the knife sank into its owner's wrist. Heathcliff yanked it out violently, slicing the flesh, and stuffed it dripping wet into his pocket. Then he grabbed a stone, broke through the partition between two windows, and jumped in."
"His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.","His opponent had lost consciousness due to unbearable pain and the blood gushing from a major artery or vein. The villain kicked and punched him, banged his head against the floorboards several times, and held me with one hand to prevent me from calling Joseph. He performed an act of superhuman self-sacrifice by not completely finishing him off; but gasping, he finally stopped and dragged the seemingly lifeless body onto the bench."
"There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once. '""What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?"" '""There's this to do,"" thundered Heathcliff, ""that your master's mad; and should he last another month, I'll have him to an asylum. And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don't stand muttering and mumbling there.","There, he tore Earnshaw's coat sleeve and bandaged the wound with brutal force. He spat and cursed, kicking as hard as he did. Free again, I hurried to fetch the old servant. He was beginning to understand what I had hastily said and rushed down the stairs, panting, two at a time. ""What shall we do now? What shall we do now?"" ""So,"" thundered Heathcliff, ""your master is mad; and if he lives another month, I'll send him to an asylum. And how on earth did you lock me up, you toothless dog? Don't stand there muttering all the time."""
"Come, I'm not going to nurse him. Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle - it is more than half brandy!"" '""And so ye've been murthering on him?"" exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and eyes in horror. ""If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the Lord - "" 'Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows. '""Oh, I forgot you,"" said the tyrant. ""You shall do that.","Come on, I won't take care of him. Wash that thing for me and watch the sparks from your candle! It's more than half brandy! ""And then you mutter about him!"" cried Joseph, throwing his hands and eyes up in horror. ""If I ever see such a thing! May the Lord—"" Heathcliff gently pushed him to his knees in the middle of the blood and threw him a napkin. But instead of wiping it away, he clasped his hands and began a prayer whose strange wording made me laugh. I was in a state where nothing surprised me anymore: I was even as careless as some criminals at the foot of the gallows. ""Oh, I have forgotten you,"" said the tyrant. ""You will forget him."""
"Down with you. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? There, that is work fit for you!"" 'He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.","""Done! And you're conspiring with him against me, Viper? Listen, that's your job!"" He shook me until my teeth chattered and sat me down next to Joseph, who finished his pleas vigorously, then stood up and swore to leave for the estate immediately. Mr. Linton was a justice of the peace, and despite his fifty lost wives, he would continue to investigate."
"He was so obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness.","He persisted so persistently that Heathcliff deemed it advisable to extract a summary of what had happened from me. Trembling with malice, he stood over me while I reluctantly gave him the account in answer to his questions. It took the old man great effort to convince him that Heathcliff was not the aggressor, especially in light of my succinct answers. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was still alive. Joseph hastened to administer a dose of strong liquor, and his master soon regained consciousness."
"Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily. 'This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.","Heathcliff, knowing that his antagonist was ignorant of the treatment he had received while unconscious, called him a mad drunkard and advised him to dwell no further on his abominable behavior, but to go to bed. To my great joy, after this wise advice, he left us, and Hindley stretched himself out on the mantelpiece. I returned to my room, surprised at how easily I had escaped. ""This morning, as I went downstairs about midnight, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting gravely ill by the fire; his evil ghost, almost as thin and hideous, was leaning against the mantelpiece."
"Neither appeared inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw's seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him. 'Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.","None of us seemed in the mood for dinner, and after waiting until everything on the table had cooled, I began to eat alone. Nothing prevented me from eating heartily, and I felt a certain satisfaction and superiority in glancing occasionally at my silent companions and feeling the comforting sense of a clear conscience. After I had finished, I took the unusual liberty of stepping close to the fire, walking around Earnshaw's chair, and kneeling beside him in a corner. Heathcliff did not look at me, and I looked up and observed his face with almost as much certainty as if it were petrified."
"His forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have covered my face in the presence of such grief. In HIS case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.' 'Fie, fie, Miss!' I interrupted. 'One might suppose you had never opened a Bible in your life.","His brow, which I had once considered so manly and which now seemed so diabolical, was obscured by a heavy cloud; his bastard eyes were almost extinguished by sleeplessness and perhaps also by tears, for his eyelashes were moist; his lips, deprived of their fierce smile, were covered with an expression of unspeakable sorrow. Had it happened at any other time, I would have hidden my face from such grief. In his case, I felt flattered; and however unworthy it might seem to insult a fallen enemy, I could not pass up this opportunity to shoot an arrow: his weakness was the only moment in which I could savor the joy of returning wrong with wrong. ""Fie, fie, miss!"" I interrupted. ""One would think you had never opened a Bible in your life."""
"If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his!' 'In general I'll allow that it would be, Ellen,' she continued; 'but what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it? I'd rather he suffered less, if I might cause his sufferings and he might KNOW that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much.","If God torments your enemies, that should be enough. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torments to his! ""In general, I admit it, Ellen,"" she continued; ""but what suffering could Heathcliff alleviate for me if I had nothing to do with it? I would rather he suffer less if I could cause his suffering and he KNOW that I am the cause. Oh, I owe him so much."""
"On only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him the first to implore pardon; and then - why then, Ellen, I might show you some generosity.","I can only forgive him on one condition: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every stab, a blow back; to bring him down to my level. Since he hurt him first, he should ask for forgiveness first; and then... well, Ellen, perhaps I could show you a little generosity."
"But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, and asked him how he was. '""Not as ill as I wish,"" he replied. ""But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!"" '""Yes, no wonder,"" was my next remark. ""Catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It's well people don't REALLY rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?"" '""I can't say,"" he answered, ""but what do you mean? Did he dare to strike me when I was down?"" '""He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,"" I whispered. ""And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because he's only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend."" 'Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features. '""Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony, I'd go to hell with joy,"" groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle. '""Nay, it's enough that he has murdered one of you,"" I observed aloud. ""At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff.","But I absolutely cannot take revenge, and therefore cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted water, so I gave him a glass and asked how he was. ""Not as sick as I'd like,"" he replied. ""But if I don't take my arm away, every inch of my body aches as if I'd been fighting a legion of demons!"" ""Yes, no wonder,"" I then replied. ""Catherine always boasted that she would stick by you and not hurt you physically: she said that some people wouldn't hurt you for fear of offending her. It's a good thing people don't REALLY come back to life, or she would have been a terrible sight last night! Don't you have bruises and cuts on your chest and shoulders?"" ""I can't say,"" he replied, ""but what do you think? Did he dare hit me when I was already on the ground?"" ""He stamped on you, kicked you, and threw you to the ground,"" I muttered. ""And his mouth watered as he tore you with his teeth; for he is only half a man: not so much, and the rest is a devil."" Mr. Earnshaw, like me, gazed into the face of our common enemy; this one, sunk in anguish, seemed insensible to everything around him: the more still he lay, the more clearly his reflections revealed their blackness through his features. ""Oh, if God gave me the strength to strangle him in my agony, I would go to hell for joy,"" moaned the impatient man, writhing to rise and sinking down in despair, convinced of his inability to resist. ""No, it is enough that he has murdered one of you,"" I remarked aloud. ""Everyone at the Grange knows that your sister would still be alive if it had not been for Mr. Heathcliff."
"After all, it is preferable to be hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were - how happy Catherine was before he came - I'm fit to curse the day."" 'Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs.","After all, it is better to be hated than loved. When I think back to our happiness—Catherine's happiness before her birth—I could curse this day. Heathcliff probably recognized the truth of what was said better than the speaker's mind. His attention was aroused, I could see, for his eyes shed tears into the ashes, and he breathed chokingly."
"I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision. '""Get up, and begone out of my sight,"" said the mourner. 'I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly intelligible. '""I beg your pardon,"" I replied. ""But I loved Catherine too; and her brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now, that she's dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and her - "" '""Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!"" he cried, making a movement that caused me to make one also. '""But then,"" I continued, holding myself ready to flee, ""if poor Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar picture! SHE wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice."" 'The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it at my head.","I looked him straight in the eyes and laughed contemptuously. For a moment, the misty lights of hell shone back at me; but the devil, who usually kept watch, was so dim and drowned that I was not afraid of hearing another mocking sound. ""Stand up and get out of my sight,"" said the mourner. ""At least, I suspected he had said those words, though his voice was barely audible."" ""Excuse me,"" I replied. ""But I loved Catherine too; and her brother needs care, and for her sake, I will provide it. Now that she is dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has nothing but her eyes, if you hadn't tried to gouge them out and dye them black and red; and she—"" ""Stand up, you poor fool, before I trample you to death!"" he cried, making a gesture that made me do the same. ""Well,"" I continued, preparing to run away, ""if poor Catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, and degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have painted a similar picture! She would not have borne your vile behavior in peace: her horror and disgust must have made themselves felt."" ""The back of the sofa and Earnshaw stood between him and me. Instead of trying to reach me, he snatched a dinner knife from the table and threw it at my head."""
"It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon-light of the Grange.","She struck me under the ear, interrupting the sentence I was about to utter; but I held it back, rushed to the door, and hurled another, hoping it would fly a little farther than her missile. The last I saw of her was a furious attack, averted by the embrace of her host; and both fell huddled on the hearth. Fleeing through the kitchen, I bade Joseph hasten to his master; I overturned Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies over the back of the chair in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I leaped, leaped, and dashed down the steep street; then, leaving the winding roads, I shot across the moor, rolled over the banks, and waded through the marshes: I did fall upon the landmark of the Grange."
"And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.' Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south, near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.","And I would much rather be condemned to eternal hell than linger for even a single night under the roof of Wuthering Heights again. Isabella paused and took a sip of tea; then she stood up and ordered me to put on my hat and a large shawl I had brought with me. Ignoring my entreaties for an hour, she climbed onto a chair, kissed the portraits of Edgar and Catherine, bowed to me in the same way, and climbed into the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who shouted with joy at seeing her mistress again. She was taken away and was never to set foot in these parts again; but once things had calmed down, a regular correspondence developed between her and my master. I believe her new home was in the south, near London; a son was born there a few months after her escape."
"He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish creature. Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived. I refused to tell.","He was christened Linton, and from the beginning she called him a sickly, gloomy creature. Mr. Heathcliff, whom I met one day in the village, asked me where she lived. I refused to tell him."
"He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn't molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.","He pointed out that this wasn't a problem, but she should be careful not to go to her brother's: she couldn't be with him if he had to take care of her himself. Although I didn't give him any information, he learned of her whereabouts and the child's existence from other servants. Nevertheless, he didn't bother her: a patience she probably owed to his dislike."
"He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: 'They wish me to hate it too, do they?' 'I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' I answered. 'But I'll have it,' he said, 'when I want it. They may reckon on that!' Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more. On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit I had no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing nothing.","He often asked me about the baby when he saw me; and when he heard its name, he would smile gloomily and say, ""They want me to hate it too, don't they?"" ""I don't think they want you to know anything,"" I replied. ""But I shall have it,"" he said, ""whenever I need it. They can depend on it!"" Fortunately, his mother died before then, some thirteen years after Catherine's death, when Linton was twelve or a little older. The day after Isabella's unexpected visit, I had no opportunity to speak to my master; he avoided all conversation and was not inclined to any discussion."
"When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers were abroad.","When I made him listen to me, I saw that he took pleasure in his sister's abandonment; he hated it with an intensity his gentle nature seemed hardly able to bear. His disgust was so deep and sensitive that he avoided going anywhere where he could see or hear Heathcliff. Grief and all this combined made him a complete recluse: he gave up his magistrate's office, stopped even going to church, avoided the village at all costs, and lived a life of complete seclusion within the confines of his park and estate, broken only by solitary walks on the moor and visits to his wife's grave, usually in the evening or early morning, before the other tramps came out."
"But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long. HE didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.","But he was too good to be truly unhappy for long. He didn't pray that Catherine's soul would torment him. Time brought him resignation and a melancholy sweeter than ordinary joy."
"He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was gone. And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his heart.","He remembered her with deep, tender love and longed for a better world, to which he had undoubtedly passed. And he also felt earthly comfort and affection. For a few days, I say, the insignificant successor of the deceased seemed indifferent to him: the cold melted as quickly as snow in April, and before the little creature could stammer a word or take a step, she wielded the scepter of a despot in his heart."
"It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than from its being his own. I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances.","Her name was Catherine; but he never called her by her full name, just as he had never called the first Catherine by her shortened form: probably because Heathcliff was used to that name. The little girl was always called Cathy: for him, this marked a distinction from his mother, but also a connection to her; and his affection stemmed much more from this relationship with her than from the fact that she was his own daughter. I often compared him to Hindley Earnshaw and couldn't really explain why her behavior in similar situations was so contradictory."
"They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.","They had both been beloved husbands and had cared lovingly for their children. I couldn't imagine that they couldn't have followed the same path, for better or for worse. Yet, I thought, Hindley, seemingly the stronger of the two, had unfortunately proven himself the worse and weaker. When his ship ran aground, the captain abandoned his post. And instead of trying to save him, the crew descended into rebellion and confusion, leaving no hope for their ill-fated vessel."
"Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped, and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them. But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and that's the same.","Linton, on the other hand, demonstrated the true courage of a faithful and believing soul: he trusted in God, and God comforted him. One hoped, the other despaired: they had chosen their fate and were justly condemned to suffer it. But you will not hear my moral teachings, Mr. Lockwood; you will judge all these things as best as I can. At least you will believe it, and it is the same thing."
"The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his sister's: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my master. 'Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, 'it's yours and my turn to go into mourning at present.","Earnshaw's death was as expected; it followed his sister's barely six months later. At the Grange, we never received a brief account of his condition; I learned only that he would be assisting with the funeral arrangements. Mr. Kenneth came to inform my master of the event. ""Well, Nelly,"" he said, coming into the garden one morning, too early not to immediately startle me with an uneasy feeling, ""now it's your and my turn to take over the mourning."""
"Who's given us the slip now, do you think?' 'Who?' I asked in a flurry. 'Why, guess!' he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door. 'And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm certain you'll need it.' 'Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed. 'What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor. 'No, Heathcliff's a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I've just seen him. He's rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.' 'Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently. 'Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, 'and my wicked gossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while.","""Who do you think has caught us now?"" ""Who?"" I asked excitedly. ""Guess!"" he replied, dismounting and hanging his bridle on a hook by the door. ""And pinch your apron. You'll certainly need it."" ""It's not Mr. Heathcliff, is it?"" I exclaimed. ""What? You'd mourn him?"" said the doctor. ""No, Heathcliff is a strong young man. He's beaming today. I've just seen him. He's gained weight rapidly since losing his better half."" ""Who is it, Mr. Kenneth?"" I repeated impatiently. ""Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,"" he replied, ""and my gossips. Although he's been too wild for me for so long."""
"There! I said we should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character: drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I'm sorry, too.","Wow! I told you we had to get some water. But cheer up! He died as he was: drunk as a king. Poor boy! I feel sorry for him, too."
"One can't help missing an old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He's barely twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you were born in one year?' I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question - 'Had he had fair play?' Whatever I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the dead.","One simply misses an old comrade, even if he has played the worst tricks on me and caused me much grief. He is barely twenty-seven, it seems; that is your age: who would have thought you would live less than a year? I must confess, this blow struck me harder than the shock of Mrs. Linton's death: old memories still tormented me; I sat on the veranda and wept like a relative, begging Mr. Kenneth to fetch another servant to present him to the master. I could not help thinking of the question, ""Did he play fairly?"" Whatever I did, the thought kept haunting me: it was so painfully persistent that I decided to ask permission to go to Wuthering Heights and pay my respects to the dead."
"Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in- law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.","Mr. Linton was very hesitant, but I defended him eloquently, explaining that my old man and my foster brother were just as entitled to my services as he was. I also reminded him that the Hareton child was his wife's nephew, and since there were no close relatives, he should act as guardian. He had to deal with the inheritance and attend to his brother-in-law's affairs. He was unable to attend to such matters at the time, but asked me to speak to his lawyer, and eventually he allowed me to leave."
"His lawyer had been Earnshaw's also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar. 'His father died in debt,' he said; 'the whole property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.' When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I chose. 'Correctly,' he remarked, 'that fool's body should he buried at the cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind.","His lawyer was also from Earnshaw. I drove to the village and asked him to accompany me. He shook his head and advised me to leave Heathcliff alone. He assured me that if the truth came out, Hareton would be little more than a beggar. ""His father died in debt,"" he said. ""The entire estate is mortgaged, and the natural heir's only recourse is to induce the creditor to treat him leniently."" When I arrived at Heights, I explained that I had come to see how things were. Joseph, who seemed somewhat sad, expressed his pleasure at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he hadn't realized I was needed; but I could stay to arrange the funeral if I wished. ""Quite right,"" he remarked, ""that fool's body should be buried at the crossroads without much ceremony."""
"I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard him sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle: flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more stir about him!' The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered: 'I'd rayther he'd goan hisseln for t' doctor! I sud ha,' taen tent o' t' maister better nor him - and he warn't deead when I left, naught o' t' soart!' I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket.","I left him alone for ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in the meantime he slammed both house doors in my face and spent the night drinking himself to death! We broke in this morning, for we heard him playing like a horse; and there he was lying on the sofa: skinning and scalping him would not have roused him. I sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not before the animal was reduced to carrion: he was dead, cold, and dead; so you will admit it was useless to make any more noise about him! The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered, ""I wish he had gone to the doctor himself! I have just got a tent from the master, a better one than he—and he wasn't dead when I went, not at all!"" I insisted on a proper burial. Mr. Heathcliff said I could do what I liked, but he wished to remind me that the money for the whole thing came out of his own pocket."
"He maintained a hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'Now, my bonny lad, you are MINE! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!' The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.","He seemed hard and careless, expressing neither joy nor sorrow, but rather a raw satisfaction at a job well done. Once, I even caught a brief glimmer of joy on his face: it was just as the people were carrying the coffin out of the house. He had the hypocrisy of a mourner: before following Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child onto the table and murmured with strange enthusiasm: ""Now, my dear, you're mine! And let's see if one tree doesn't grow as crooked as another, blown by the same wind!"" The innocent man was delighted by these words: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers and stroked his cheek; but I guessed the meaning and remarked dryly, ""The boy must come back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir."""
"There is nothing in the world less yours than he is!' 'Does Linton say so?' he demanded. 'Of course - he has ordered me to take him,' I replied. 'Well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove it. I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.' This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering.","Nothing in the world belongs to you less than he does! ""Did Linton say so?"" he asked. ""Of course he ordered me to take him,"" I replied. ""Well,"" said the villain, ""let's not talk about it now, but I intend to raise a child; I know your master so well that if he tries to take him away, I must take his place beside mine. I won't leave Hareton unchallenged, but I'll make sure the other one comes! Don't forget to warn him."" This hint was enough to tie our hands. I repeated the gist of the matter on my return; and Edgar Linton, who had shown little interest at first, said nothing more about interference."
"I'm not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been ever so willing. The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm possession, and proved to the attorney who, in his turn, proved it to Mr. Linton - that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.","I don't know if he could have done it intentionally, or if he would have wanted it. The guest was now the lord and master of Wuthering Heights: he held it firmly in his hands and proved to the lawyer, who in turn proved it to Mr. Linton, that Earnshaw had mortgaged every inch of his land to satisfy his gambling addiction; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. Thus Hareton, who was now to be the most important man in the neighborhood, found himself in utter dependence on his father's inveterate enemy; living as a servant in his own house, without any wages, utterly unable to earn a living, friendless, and unaware that he had been wronged."
"THE twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest, after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton's dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws' handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling hair.","The twelve years following that dark time, Mrs. Dean continued, were the happiest of my life. My greatest worries during that time were the little aches and pains of our little lady, which she had to endure like all children, rich or poor. Besides, after the first six months, she had grown like a larch and could walk and talk in her own way before the heather bloomed again over Mrs. Linton's dust. She was the sweetest thing that ever brought sunshine into a deserted house: a face of real beauty, with the lovely dark eyes of the Earnshaws, but also the fair skin, fine features, and curly blond hair of the Lintons."
"Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender. However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts.","She was cheerful without being brutal and had a sensitive heart, ready for excessive affection. This capacity for intense affection reminded me of her mother, albeit in a different way: She could be gentle and tender as a dove, and she had a soft voice and a thoughtful expression. Her anger was never furious; her love was never passionate, but deep and tender. One must admit, however, that she also had weaknesses that negated her talents."
"A propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If a servant chanced to vex her, it was always - 'I shall tell papa!' And if he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an amusement.","A penchant for impudence was part of it, as was a perverse will that spoiled children inevitably develop, whether they are well-behaved or grumpy. If a servant accidentally provoked her, the answer was always, ""I'll tell Papa!"" And if he reprimanded her, even with just a look, it would break your heart: I don't think he ever said a single harsh word to her. He took full responsibility for her upbringing and made it his own pleasure."
"Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching. Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.","Fortunately, her curiosity and sharp mind made her a capable student: she learned quickly and enthusiastically and followed her lessons conscientiously. Until she was thirteen, she never left the park alone. Mr. Linton sometimes took her for walks of about two kilometers, but never entrusted her to anyone else."
"Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only building she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe 'Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills? I wonder what lies on the other side - is it the sea?' 'No, Miss Cathy,' I would answer; 'it is hills again, just like these.' 'And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?' she once asked.","Gimmerton was an insignificant name to her; the chapel was the only building she had ever approached or entered, apart from her own house. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she lived in complete retirement and apparently perfectly happy. Sometimes, as she looked out of her nursery window at the scenery, she would ask, ""Ellen, how long will it be before I reach the top of these hills? I wonder what is on the other side; is it the sea?"" ""No, Miss Cathy,"" I answered, ""they are hills again, like these."" ""And what do those golden rocks look like when you stand under them?"" she asked one day."
"The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree. 'And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?' she pursued. 'Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,' replied I; 'you could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!' 'Oh, you have been on them!' she cried gleefully. 'Then I can go, too, when I am a woman.","The steep slope of the Penistone Cliffs caught her attention, especially when the setting sun illuminated them, casting the highest peaks and the entire surrounding landscape into shadow. I explained to her that they were bare masses of rock, with barely enough earth in their crevices to support a stunted tree. ""And why do they shine here so long after dark?"" she continued. ""Because they are much higher than we are,"" I replied. ""You can't climb them; they are too high and too steep. In winter, the frost always comes before us; and in late summer, I found snow beneath that black hollow to the northeast!"" ""Oh, you've been there before!"" she cried cheerfully. ""Then I can go there too, when I'm a woman."""
"Has papa been, Ellen?' 'Papa would tell you, Miss,' I answered, hastily, 'that they are not worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.' 'But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself. 'And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.' One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he promised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss Catherine measured her age by months, and, 'Now, am I old enough to go to Penistone Crags?' was the constant question in her mouth.","Was Papa there, Ellen? ""Papa would tell you, Miss,"" I answered hastily, ""that it's not worth visiting. The moors where you walk with him are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the loveliest place in the world."" ""But I know that park, and I don't know this,"" she murmured. ""And I should love to look down on the surroundings from that high spot: my little pony, Minny, will take me."" When one of the maids mentioned the Fairy Grotto, she turned her head this way and that, eager to undertake the project; she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he promised that she would make the trip when she was older. But Miss Catherine measured her age in months, and ""Am I old enough now to go to Penistone Crags?"" was the question she was constantly asking herself."
"The road thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, 'Not yet, love: not yet.' I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.","The road wound all the way to Wuthering Heights. Edgar didn't have the courage to venture there, so he was often told, ""Not yet, my dear, not yet."" I explained that Mrs. Heathcliff had left her husband more than twelve years ago. Her family was in poor health; neither she nor Edgar possessed the health common in that area."
"What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education.","I do not know exactly what her last illness was; I suppose they died of the same disease, a kind of fever that began slowly but was incurable, and rapidly destroyed their lives towards the end. She wrote to her brother to inform him of the probable issue of her four months' illness, and urged him to visit her if possible; for she had much to do and wished to take leave of him and leave Linton safely in his care. She hoped Linton would remain with him as he had been with her: her father, she liked to tell herself, would undertake neither her support nor her education."
"My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied. He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might entertain herself.","My master did not hesitate to comply with her request: although she was reluctant to leave the house for her usual visits, he quickly rushed to meet her and answer her. Catherine ordered me to be especially vigilant during his absence and repeatedly ordered her not to leave the park; even under my supervision, he did not expect her to go alone. He remained absent for three weeks. For the first two days, my pupil sat in a corner of the library, too busy to read or play. In this tranquil state, she gave me little trouble; but then came a period of impatient and irritable fatigue; and since I was then too busy and too old to entertain her, I devised a way to amuse her."
"I used to send her on her travels round the grounds - now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned. The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were generally looked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide open.","I often sent her for walks around the grounds, sometimes on foot, sometimes on a pony, and on her return I patiently welcomed her in all her adventures, real or imagined. The summer seemed to be at its best; she enjoyed these solitary walks so much that she often managed to stay away from breakfast until tea-time; and then she spent her evenings telling her fantastic stories. I had no fear that she might go too far; for the gates were usually guarded, and I thought she would hardly venture out alone if they were wide open."
"Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced. Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come back early.","Unfortunately, my confidence proved misplaced. One morning at eight o'clock, Catherine came to me and told me she was an Arab merchant who would be crossing the desert with her caravan that day. I was to provide her with ample provisions for herself and her animals: a horse and three camels, accompanied by a large hunting dog and two pointing dogs. I gathered a generous supply of delicacies and hung them in a basket on the side of the saddle. She jumped up, cheerful as a fairy, protected from the July sun by her broad-brimmed hat and gauze veil, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my wise advice not to gallop and to return early."
"The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds.","The mischievous animal didn't appear during tea. A traveler, the hunting dog, an old dog enjoying his leisurely stroll, returned; but Cathy, the pony, and the two pointers were nowhere to be seen. I sent messengers down one path, then another, then another, and finally set out to find him. A laborer was working on a fence surrounding a plantation at the edge of the property."
"I inquired of him if he had seen our young lady. 'I saw her at morn,' he replied: 'she would have me to cut her a hazel switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and galloped out of sight.' You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly she must have started for Penistone Crags. 'What will become of her?' I ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I detect, far or near.","I asked him if he had seen our young lady. ""I saw her this morning,"" he replied. ""She wanted me to cut down a hazel tree for her, and then she bounded her Galloway over the hedge where it lay lowest and galloped out of sight."" Imagine how I felt when I heard this news. I knew at once that she must be on her way to Penistone Crags. ""What will happen to her?"" I cried, squeezing through a gap the man was repairing and running straight for the main road. I marched like a punter for mile after mile until, around a bend, I could see the Heights; but I could see Catherine neither far nor near."
"The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. 'And what if she should have slipped in clambering among them,' I reflected, 'and been killed, or broken some of her bones?' My suspense was truly painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw. 'Ah,' said she, 'you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don't be frightened.","The Crags are about four kilometers from Mr. Heathcliff's house, which in turn is five kilometers from the Grange. I therefore began to fear that it would be dark before I could reach them. ""What if she had gone and crept in,"" I wondered, ""and been killed, or broken a bone or two?"" My wait was truly agonizing; and at first, I felt a delicious relief when I saw Charlie, the fiercest of the Magi, run past the farmhouse and lie down under a window with a swollen head and a bleeding ear. I opened the gate and ran to the door, knocking vigorously to get in. An acquaintance of mine who lived in Gimmerton opened the door; she had been employed there as a maid since Mr. Earnshaw's death. ""Ah!"" she said, ""you are looking for your little mistress! Have no fear."""
"She's here safe: but I'm glad it isn't the master.' 'He is not at home then, is he?' I panted, quite breathless with quick walking and alarm. 'No, no,' she replied: 'both he and Joseph are off, and I think they won't return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.' I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother's when a child. Her hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton - now a great, strong lad of eighteen - who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth. 'Very well, Miss!' I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry countenance. 'This is your last ride, till papa comes back.","She's safe here, but I'm glad it's not the master. ""Then he's not home?"" I gasped, panting with panic and haste. ""No, no,"" she answered. ""He and Joseph are gone, and I don't think they'll be back for another hour or two. Come in and rest a bit."" I went in and saw my homeless lamb sitting by the fire, rocking in a little chair that had belonged to his mother as a child. Her hat was hanging on the wall, and she seemed quite relaxed. She was laughing and chatting in the best humor imaginable, while Hareton—now a tall, sturdy boy of eighteen—stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment, hardly understanding the whirlwind of remarks and questions that incessantly escaped his lips. ""All right, miss!"" I cried, hiding my joy behind a glare. ""This will be your last walk until Papa comes back."""
"I'll not trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!' 'Aha, Ellen!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. 'I shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out. Have you ever been here in your life before?' 'Put that hat on, and home at once,' said I. 'I'm dreadfully grieved at you, Miss Cathy: you've done extremely wrong! It's no use pouting and crying: that won't repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith in you any more.' 'What have I done?' sobbed she, instantly checked. 'Papa charged me nothing: he'll not scold me, Ellen - he's never cross, like you!' 'Come, come!' I repeated. 'I'll tie the riband.","""I won't trust you on the threshold again, you naughty girl!"" she cried, jumping up gaily and running up to me. ""I'm going to tell you a nice story tonight; and that's how you caught me. Have you ever been here before?"" she cried, putting on her hat and going in at once. ""I'm so sorry for you, Miss Cathy: you've made a dreadful mistake! There's no use sulking and crying; it won't make up for the trouble I had in searching for you all over the country. To think that Mr. Linton asked me to keep you in the house, and you just run off like that! That shows you're a cunning little vixen, and no one will ever trust you again. What have I done?"" she sobbed, interrupting him at once. ""Papa didn't ask me anything: he doesn't scold me, Ellen, he's never cross like you!"" ""Come on, come on!"" I repeated. I tied the ribbon."
"Now, let us have no petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!' This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and retreating to the chimney out of my reach. 'Nay,' said the servant, 'don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean. We made her stop: she'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be uneasy.","""Let's stop arguing. Oh, what a pity! You're thirteen and a baby!"" This exclamation was provoked by her pushing back her hat and retreating to the fireplace, out of my reach. ""No,"" said the chambermaid, ""don't be too hard on the pretty girl, Mrs. Dean. We made her stop; she wanted to go on for fear of embarrassing you."""
"Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it's a wild road over the hills.' Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion. 'How long am I to wait?' I continued, disregarding the woman's interference. 'It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so please yourself.' 'The pony is in the yard,' she replied, 'and Phoenix is shut in there. He's bitten - and so is Charlie.","Hareton offered to accompany her, and I thought he should: it's a wild road through the mountains. Hareton kept his hands in his pockets throughout the conversation, too embarrassed to speak; though he didn't seem to appreciate my intrusion. ""How long must I wait?"" I asked, ignoring the woman's intervention. ""It will be dark in ten minutes. Where's the pony, Miss Cathy? And where's Phoenix? I'll leave you alone if you don't hurry; then do it yourself."" ""The pony's in the yard,"" she replied, ""and Phoenix's locked up there. He's been bitten, just like Charlie."""
"I was going to tell you all about it; but you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.' I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue. Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation, - 'Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.' 'It's YOUR father's, isn't it?' said she, turning to Hareton. 'Nay,' he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully. He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his own. 'Whose then - your master's?' she asked.","I wanted to tell you everything, but you are in a bad mood and don't deserve to hear it. I took her hat and went over to give it to her. But when she saw that the people in the house were supporting her, she ran about the room. When I pursued her, she ran like a mouse over, under, and behind the furniture, making every pursuit ridiculous. Hareton and the woman laughed, and she laughed along with them, becoming more and more impudent. Until, in complete annoyance, I exclaimed, ""Why, Miss Cathy, if you only knew whose house this is, you would like to go."" ""It's your father's, isn't it?"" she said, turning to Hareton. ""No,"" he answered, lowering his eyes and blushing shyly. He could not bear her stare, even though it was only his. ""Whose, then? Your master's?"" she asked."
"He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and turned away. 'Who is his master?' continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. 'He talked about ""our house,"" and ""our folk."" I thought he had been the owner's son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn't he, if he's a servant?' Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure. 'Now, get my horse,' she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. 'And you may come with me.","He blushed even more, his emotions altered, muttered a curse, and turned away. ""Who is his master?"" the girl continued wearily, begging for my favor. ""He spoke of 'our house' and 'our people.' I thought he was the lord of the manor's son. And he never said 'Miss': he should have if he were a servant?"" Hareton turned black as a thunderstorm at these childish words. I shook my questioner mutely and finally managed to persuade her to leave. ""Now fetch my horse,"" she said, addressing her unknown relative as the manor's groom. ""And you may come with me."""
"I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about the FAIRISHES, as you call them: but make haste! What's the matter? Get my horse, I say.' 'I'll see thee damned before I be THY servant!' growled the lad. ""You'll see me WHAT!' asked Catherine in surprise. 'Damned - thou saucy witch!' he replied. 'There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,' I interposed. 'Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don't begin to dispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.' 'But, Ellen,' cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, 'how dare he speak so to me? Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked creature, I shall tell papa what you said. - Now, then!' Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation. 'You bring the pony,' she exclaimed, turning to the woman, 'and let my dog free this moment!' 'Softly, Miss,' answered she addressed: 'you'll lose nothing by being civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he's your cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.' 'HE my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh. 'Yes, indeed,' responded her reprover. 'Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,' she pursued in great trouble. 'Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a gentleman's son.","I want to see where the goblin hunter turns up in the swamp and hear about the FAIRIES, as you call them. But hurry! What is it? Go and get my horse, I tell you.' 'I'd sooner have you damned than become your servant!' growled the boy. 'You'll show me WHAT!' asked Catherine in surprise. 'Good heavens, you impudent witch!' he retorted. 'Listen, Miss Cathy! You see you've fallen into good company,' I interrupted. 'Fine words for a young lady! Don't argue with him, please. Come, let's find Minny ourselves and then be off.' 'But Ellen,' she cried, looking astonished, 'how dare he speak to me like that? Mustn't he be forced to do what I ask? Vile creature, I'll tell Papa what you said.' 'Come!' Hareton seemed oblivious to this threat; tears of indignation welled up in his eyes. 'Bring in the pony,' she cried, turning to the woman, 'and untie my dog at once!' 'Steady, Miss,' she replied. 'You lose nothing by being civil. Although Mr. Hareton is not the master's son, he is your nephew, and I have never been obliged to serve you.' 'He is my nephew!' cried Cathy with a contemptuous laugh. 'Yes, indeed,' replied her interlocutor. 'Oh, Ellen! Don't let them say such things,' she continued with great effort. 'Father has gone to London to fetch my nephew. My nephew is a gentleman's son.'"
"That my - ' she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown. 'Hush, hush!' I whispered; 'people can have many cousins and of all sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.' 'He's not - he's not my cousin, Ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea. I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations; having no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred. Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought.","""That's my—"" She paused and wept heartily, overcome by the mere thought of an affair with such a clown. ""Shh!"" I murmured. ""One may have many cousins of all kinds, Miss Cathy, and yet one does not suffer for them; only they do not need one's company when they are disagreeable and nasty."" ""He is not—he is not my cousin, Ellen!"" she continued, feeling a new surge of grief at the thought and throwing herself into my arms to protect herself from it. ""I was very annoyed at their mutual revelations, she and the maid; I did not doubt that Linton's impending arrival, which Linton had informed me of, had been reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and I felt equally certain that Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to demand an explanation of his accusations regarding his uncouth relatives."" Hareton, who had recovered from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by his grief; and after leading the pony to the door, to appease it, he brought from the stable a fine, bow-legged terrier, held it out to it, and commanded it to whistle! For it would say nothing."
"Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew. I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features, and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.","She paused, looked at him with an expression of fear and disgust, and then cried again: ""I could hardly suppress a smile at this dislike for the poor fellow. He was a well-built, athletic, handsome, robust, and healthy young man, but he wore clothes suited to his daily pursuits: working on the farm, lounging on the moor, hunting rabbits and deer. Yet I thought I recognized in his features a mind more perfect than his father's."""
"Good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice.","Well-understood things were lost in a wilderness of weeds whose luxuriance far exceeded their neglected growth; yet signs were discernible of a fertile soil which, under other and more favorable circumstances, might yield bountiful harvests. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him violently, thanks to his intrepid nature, which left no room for the temptation to oppress him: he possessed none of the anxious susceptibility which, according to Heathcliff, would have made abuse tempting. He seemed to have taken advantage of his wickedness to transform him into a brute: he had never learned to read or write; had never censured a bad habit that did not irritate his companion; had never taken a step towards virtue, nor had he been protected from vice by a single precept."
"And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a narrow- minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their 'offald ways,' so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn't correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.","And, as I understand, Joseph contributed significantly to his downfall by harboring a narrow-minded prejudice that led him, from an early age, to flatter and cajole him, for he was the head of the family. And just as he had accused Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, as children, of over-trying their master's patience and forcing him to console himself with alcohol by their 'wicked behavior,' as he called it, so he now laid the entire burden of Hareton's failings on the usurper of his estate. Even when the boy cursed, he did not correct him, however guilty."
"It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton's blood would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations.","Joseph evidently felt satisfaction in seeing him persevere: he admitted that the boy was ruined, that his soul was doomed; but then he remembered that Heathcliff would have to pay the price. Hareton's blood would be exacted from him; and this thought gave him great comfort. Joseph had instilled in him pride in his name and lineage; had he dared, he would have stirred hatred between himself and the current owner of the Heights; but his fear of that owner was superstition; and he limited his feelings toward him to whispered allusions and private conversations."
"I don't pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was NEAR, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley's time were not now enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.","I do not claim to know much about life at Wuthering Heights at that time; I speak only from hearsay, for I saw little of it. The villagers claimed that Mr. Heathcliff was in the neighborhood and was a cruel and severe landlord to his tenants; but under the management of a woman, the house had regained its former comfortable character, and the boisterous scenes common in Hindley's time no longer occurred. The master was too gloomy to seek the company of people, good or bad; and he still is."
"This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.","But that doesn't get me anywhere. Miss Cathy rejected the terrier's peace offering and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix. They arrived limping and with their heads hanging; and we went home in utter despair."
"I could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to accompany her.","I couldn't get any explanation from my little lady as to how she had spent the day, except that, as I suspected, the destination of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags. She reached the farm without incident when Hareton happened to appear, accompanied by two dogs that attacked his retinue. They fought fiercely before their masters could separate them: this was an introduction. Catherine explained to Hareton who she was and where she was going, and asked him to show her the way. Eventually, she succeeded in persuading him to accompany her."
"He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw. I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin.","He revealed the secrets of the Fairy Grotto and twenty other strange places. However, as I had fallen from grace, I received no credit for describing the interesting objects she had seen. I concluded, however, that her guide had been a favorite until she offended him by calling him a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper offended her favorite by calling him her nephew."
"Then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always 'love,' and 'darling,' and 'queen,' and 'angel,' with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.","Then the language he had used with her began to irritate her. She, who had always been ""my darling,"" ""my sweetheart,"" ""my queen,"" and ""my angel"" to everyone at the Grange, was to be insulted in such a shocking way by a stranger! She didn't understand; and I had to make a great effort to extract from her a promise not to complain to her father. I explained to her how he disapproved of the whole Heights household and how upset he would be if she had been there; but above all, I insisted that if she revealed my violation of his instructions, he might become so angry that I would have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear the prospect: she gave her word and kept it. After all, she was a dear little girl."
"A LETTER, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return, Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her 'real' cousin. The evening of their expected arrival came.","A black-bordered letter announced the day of my master's return. Isabelle had died; he wrote to me to arrange his daughter's funeral and to reserve a room and other accommodations for his young nephew. Catherine, delighted at the prospect of welcoming her father, indulged in the wildest hopes regarding the myriad qualities of her ""real"" nephew. The evening of her expected arrival arrived."
"Since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock - poor thing! her aunt's death impressed her with no definite sorrow - she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them. 'Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees. 'How delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter than mine - more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy - and papa, dear, dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.' She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she couldn't be still a minute. 'How long they are!' she exclaimed. 'Ah, I see, some dust on the road - they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a little way - half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say Yes: to that clump of birches at the turn!' I refused staunchly.","Since early morning she had been busy with her little affairs; and now, in her new black dress—poor thing! Her aunt's death hadn't really affected her—her constant anxiety compelled me to accompany her to the park to join them. ""Linton is only six months younger than I,"" she chattered, as we strolled quietly in the shade of the trees over the hills and valleys of mossy grass. ""How wonderful it will be to have him for a playmate! Aunt Isabella sent Papa a beautiful lock of her hair; it was lighter than mine, blonder, and just as beautiful. I keep it safe in a little glass case, and have often thought how wonderful it would be to see its owner again. Oh! I'm glad—and Papa, dear Papa! Come, Ellen, let's run! Come, let's run."" She ran and came back and ran again, several times before my quiet footsteps reached the gate. Then she sat down on the grassy bank at the side of the road and tried to wait patiently; but it was impossible: she couldn't sit still for a minute. ""How long they're taking!"" she cried. ""Ah, I see, a bit of dust on the road... they're coming! No! When will they be here? Can't we walk a bit, half a mile, Ellen, just half a mile? Say yes: as far as the clump of birch trees at the bend!"" I firmly refused."
"At length her suspense was ended: the travelling carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window. He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.","Finally, their suspense was over: the moving carriage appeared. Miss Cathy let out a scream and spread her arms when she saw her father's face out the window. He got out, almost as impatient as she was; and it was a while before they could think of anything but themselves."
"While they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.","As they caressed each other, I glanced at Linton. He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined coat, as if in winter. The pale, thin, effeminate boy could have mistaken him for my master's younger brother, so striking was the resemblance; but his appearance had a sickly, sullen quality that Edgar Linton had never possessed."
"The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the servants. 'Now, darling,' said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted at the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you directly. And don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?' 'Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: 'but I do want to see him; and he hasn't once looked out.' The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the ground by his uncle. 'This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little hands together. 'She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by crying to-night.","He noticed my glance, shook my hand, and advised me to close the door and leave him alone, as the journey had tired him. Cathy would have liked to have a look, but her father ordered her to come along, and they went together to the park, while I hurried to get the servants ready. ""Now, my dear,"" said Mr. Linton to his daughter as they stopped at the bottom of the stairs, ""your nephew is not as strong and cheerful as you are, and he lost his mother, as you remember, only recently; so don't expect him to be playing and romping with you just yet. And don't disturb him too much with your chatter: let him be quiet tonight at least, will you?"" ""Yes, yes, Papa,"" replied Catherine, ""but I want to see him; and he hasn't looked out yet."" The carriage stopped; the sleeper was awakened and set down by his uncle. ""This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,"" he said, clasping their hands. ""She already loves you, and be careful not to upset her by crying tonight."""
"Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.' 'Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's salute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears. 'Come, come, there's a good child,' I whispered, leading him in. 'You'll make her weep too - see how sorry she is for you!' I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I proceeded to remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.","Try to be cheerful now; the journey is over, and you have nothing to do but rest and enjoy life as you please. ""Then let me go to bed,"" replied the boy, shrinking from Catherine's greeting, and drying with his fingers the tears that had begun to flow. ""Come, come, there's a dear child,"" I murmured as I led him in. ""You'll make her cry too, see how she pities you!"" I don't know if it was on his account, but his cousin looked as sad as he did and went back to her father. The three went inside and went up to the library, where tea was ready. I began to take off Linton's cap and coat and set him on a chair at the table; but no sooner had he sat down than he began to cry again."
"My master inquired what was the matter. 'I can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy. 'Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,' answered his uncle patiently. He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.","My master asked what was wrong. ""I can't sit on a chair,"" the boy sobbed. ""Then go to the sofa, Ellen will bring you tea,"" his uncle answered patiently. I was convinced that his whining and sickly pupil had been testing him during the journey. Linton slowly lay down."
"Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer, like a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint smile. 'Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching them a minute. 'Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.","Cathy brought him a stool and his cup. At first, she remained quite silent, but that didn't last long: she had decided to pet her little nephew because she liked him; and she began stroking his curls, kissing him on the cheek, and offering him tea in his saucer like a baby. He was pleased, for he wasn't much better off: he wiped his eyes and smiled faintly. ""Oh, he'll be all right,"" the teacher said to me after watching them for a minute. ""Well, as long as we can keep him, Ellen."""
"The company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength he'll gain it.' 'Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be. Our doubts were presently decided - even earlier than I expected.","The company of a child of his own age will soon give him new energy, and if I wish him to grow up, he will find it. ""Oh, if only we could keep him!"" I said to myself, sensing that there was still a glimmer of hope. And then I wondered: How on earth will this weakling survive at Wuthering Heights? What kind of playmates and teachers will he have between his father and Hareton! Our doubts dissipated immediately, even faster than I expected."
"I had just taken the children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep - he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case - I had come down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with the master. 'I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable trepidation. 'A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the instant they have returned from a long journey. I don't think the master can see him.' Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat. 'Good-evening, Joseph,' I said, coldly. 'What business brings you here to-night?' 'It's Maister Linton I mun spake to,' he answered, waving me disdainfully aside. 'Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say, I'm sure he won't hear it now,' I continued. 'You had better sit down in there, and entrust your message to me.' 'Which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors.","I had just brought the children up after tea and found Linton asleep—he would not leave me in peace until I left him. I had gone downstairs and was standing at the hall table to light a candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid came out of the kitchen and told me that Joseph, Mr. Heathcliff's servant, was at the door and wished to speak to the master. ""I will ask him what he wants first,"" I said, somewhat anxiously. ""It is an unpropitious time to disturb people, especially when they have just returned from a long journey. I do not suppose the master can see him."" Joseph had crossed the kitchen as I spoke these words and appeared in the hall. He was in his best clothes, with his most moralizing and sullen expression, his hat in one hand, his stick in the other, and was just beginning to polish his shoes on the doormat. ""Good evening, Joseph,"" I said coldly. ""What brings you here tonight?"" ""I've spoken with Master Linton,"" he replied, waving me off. ""Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something specific to say to him, he certainly won't hear you now,"" I continued. ""You'd better sit over there and leave me your message."" ""What is his address?"" the man asked, scanning the row of closed doors."
"I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition - 'Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him.' Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account; but, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him.","I perceived that he was determined to reject my intercession. Reluctantly, therefore, I went to the library and announced the unwelcome visitor, advising him to leave him alone until the next day. Mr. Linton had no time to allow me to do so, for Joseph, who was sitting directly behind me, forced his way into the room, stood on the other side of the table with both fists gripped around the knob of his cane, and began in a loud voice, as if expecting resistance: ""Hathecliff has sent me for his son, and I cannot come back for him."" Edgar Linton was silent for a moment; an expression of deep sorrow came over him: he would have pitied the child for his own sake; but when he thought of Isabella's hopes and fears, her fervent wishes for her son, and her recommendation that he place him in her care, the thought of abandoning him pained him deeply, and he searched in his heart for some way to avoid it. There was no plan: the mere desire to keep him would make the supplicant more convincing: there was no alternative but to abandon him."
"However, he was not going to rouse him from his sleep. 'Tell Mr. Heathcliff,' he answered calmly, 'that his son shall come to Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very precarious.' 'Noa!' said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and assuming an authoritative air. 'Noa! that means naught.","He didn't want to wake him, though. ""Tell Mr. Heathcliff,"" he answered calmly, ""that his son is coming to Wuthering Heights tomorrow. He's in bed and is too tired for the whole journey. You can also tell him that Linton's mother wanted to leave him in my care; and at the moment his health is very poor."" ""Noah!"" said Joseph, dropping to the ground and sounding imperious. ""Noah! It means nothing."""
"Hathecliff maks noa 'count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he'll heu' his lad; und I mun tak' him - soa now ye knaw!' 'You shall not to-night!' answered Linton decisively. 'Walk down stairs at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him down. Go - ' And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room of him and closed the door. 'Varrah weell!' shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. 'To-morn, he's come hisseln, and thrust HIM out, if ye darr!' TO obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and, said he - 'As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights.","Hathecliffe cares neither for the mother nor for you Northerners; but he will nurse his boy, and I will take him—you know that now!—You will not do that tonight! Linton resolutely replied. Go downstairs at once and tell your master what I said. Ellen, bring him down. Go—"" And he helped the indignant elder with a raised arm, cleared the way, and closed the door. ""Goodbye!"" cried Joseph, backing away slowly. ""Tomorrow he will come himself, and he will cast him out if you dare! To prevent this threat from coming true, Mr. Linton ordered me to bring the boy home early on Catherine's pony. And he said: - Since we now have no influence on his fate, either for good or for ill, you must not tell my daughter where he has gone. She can no longer associate with him, and it is better for her not to know of his presence; otherwise she will become restless and long to visit the Heights."""
"Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave us.' Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o'clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey. 'My father!' he cried, in strange perplexity. 'Mamma never told me I had a father. Where does he live? I'd rather stay with uncle.' 'He lives a little distance from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.","Just tell him his father has sent for him urgently and he must leave us. Linton had great difficulty getting out of bed at five o'clock and was surprised to learn that he had to prepare for another journey. But I alleviated the situation by telling him he would be spending some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wanted to see him so badly that he didn't want to wait until he had recovered from his last trip. ""My father!"" he cried, strangely puzzled. ""Mother never told me I had a father. Where does he live? I prefer to stay with my uncle."" ""He lives a little farther from the Grange,"" I replied. ""Just on the other side of these hills: not very far, but you can walk here when you are stronger. And you would be delighted to come home and see him."""
"You must try to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.' 'But why have I not heard of him before?' asked Linton. 'Why didn't mamma and he live together, as other people do?' 'He had business to keep him in the north,' I answered, 'and your mother's health required her to reside in the south.' 'And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?' persevered the child. 'She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I to love papa? I don't know him.' 'Oh, all children love their parents,' I said. 'Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you. Let us make haste.","You must try to love him the way you loved your mother, and then he will love you. ""But why have I never heard of him?"" Linton asked. ""Why didn't they live with Mother like everyone else?"" ""He was up north for work,"" I replied, ""and your mother had to live down south for health reasons."" ""And why didn't Mother tell me about him?"" the child persisted. ""She often spoke of Uncle, and I grew fond of him long ago. How can I love Father? I don't even know him."" ""Oh, all children love their parents,"" I said. ""Your mother might have thought you'd want to be with him if she'd spoken of him so often. Let's go."""
"An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour's more sleep.' 'Is SHE to go with us,' he demanded, 'the little girl I saw yesterday?' 'Not now,' replied I. 'Is uncle?' he continued. 'No, I shall be your companion there,' I said. Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study. 'I won't go without uncle,' he cried at length: 'I can't tell where you mean to take me.' I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.","An early walk on such a fine morning is much better than sleeping an extra hour. ""Is she coming with us?"" he asked, ""the little girl I saw yesterday?"" ""Not now,"" I replied. ""Is Uncle with us?"" he continued. ""No, I'll go,"" I said. Linton sank back onto his pillow and collapsed into a brown writing table. ""I'm not going without Uncle,"" he cried at last. ""I don't know where you're taking me."" I tried to convince him that his bad mood was because he didn't want to see his father; but he stubbornly resisted every attempt to dress, and I had to ask my master for help to get him out of bed. The poor child was finally roused from bed thanks to several fallacious promises of short absence: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other equally unfounded promises, which I made and repeated at intervals during the journey."
"The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness. 'Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?' he inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue. 'It is not so buried in trees,' I replied, 'and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for you - fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the next best in the neighbourhood.","The clean, heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and Minny's sweet song finally dispelled his sadness. He began to think about his new home and its inhabitants with growing interest and animation. ""Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant as Thrushcross Grange?"" he asked, turning to take a last look at the valley, from which a light mist rose to form a fluffy cloud at the edge of the blue. ""It's not so low under the trees,"" I replied, ""and it's not so big, but you can look out over the beautiful scenery; and the air is healthier, fresher, and drier."" At first glance, the house might seem old and gloomy, but it was a respectable one: the second-best in the neighborhood."
"And you will have such nice rambles on the moors. Hareton Earnshaw - that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so yours in a manner - will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently, walk out on the hills.' 'And what is my father like?' he asked. 'Is he as young and handsome as uncle?' 'He's as young,' said I; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He'll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still, mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his own.' 'Black hair and eyes!' mused Linton. 'I can't fancy him.","And you will have such lovely walks on the moor. Hareton Earnshaw, that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and therefore in a way yours too, will show you the loveliest places. If the weather is fine, you can take a book and use a green hollow as a desk. And now and then your uncle might come by and walk with you. He often climbs the hills. ""And what is my father like?"" he asked. ""Is he as young and handsome as your uncle?"" ""He is young too,"" I said, ""but he has dark hair and dark eyes and looks sterner. Also, he is getting taller and taller. At first he may not seem very gentle and kind, for that is not his way. Be open and cordial to him. Then, of course, he will love you more than any uncle, for you are his."" ""Dark hair and dark eyes!"" thought Linton. I cannot charm him."
"Then I am not like him, am I?' 'Not much,' I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes - his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit. 'How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured. 'Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I remember not a single thing about him!' 'Why, Master Linton,' said I, 'three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now it is too late.","So I'm not like him, am I? ""Not much,"" I answered; ""not at all,"" I thought, looking with regret at my companion's pale complexion and frail figure, and at his large, dull eyes—his mother's eyes, only, unless momentarily awakened by some morbid frivolity, they no longer contained any trace of their sparkling wit. ""How strange that he never visited mama and me!"" he murmured. ""Did he ever see me? If so, I must have been a baby. I can't remember anything about him!"" ""Well, Master Linton,"" I said, ""three hundred miles is a long way; and ten years is a very different time for a grown man from what is being done for you. Probably Mr. Heathcliff wanted to go away from summer to summer, but never found a suitable opportunity; and now it's too late."""
"Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.' The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden- gate. I watched to catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.","Don't bother him with questions about it: that would only upset him, and that's not a good sign. The boy remained completely lost in thought for the rest of the journey, until we stopped at the gate of the cottage garden. I watched him, trying to capture the impressions on his face. He examined the carved facade and the low trellis, the scattered gooseberry bushes and the gnarled firs with serious attention, then shook his head: his personal feelings completely disapproved of the exterior of his new home."
"But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the table.","But he was smart enough to postpone his complaints: Perhaps there would be some compensation. Before he went downstairs, I went to the door and opened it. It was 6:30 a.m.; the family had just finished breakfast; the waiter was busy clearing and wiping the table."
"Joseph stood by his master's chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield. 'Hallo, Nelly!' said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. 'I feared I should have to come down and fetch my property myself. You've brought it, have you? Let us see what we can make of it.' He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three. 'Sure-ly,' said Joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye, Maister, an' yon's his lass!' Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a scornful laugh. 'God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!' he exclaimed. 'Hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my soul! but that's worse than I expected - and the devil knows I was not sanguine!' I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.","Joseph stood by his master's chair and told the story of a lame horse; and Hareton prepared for the campaign. ""Hello, Nelly!"" said Mr. Heathcliff when he saw me. ""I was afraid I'd have to go down and get my belongings myself. You brought them, didn't you? Let's see what can be done with them."" He stood up and walked to the door; Hareton and Joseph followed him, open-mouthed and curious. Poor Linton caused a look of fear to appear on the faces of all three. ""Surely,"" said Joseph after a long examination, ""he's changed places with you, sir, and you're his daughter!"" Heathcliff, who had been staring forlornly at his son, laughed contemptuously. ""My goodness! What a beauty! What a sweet, charming creature!"" he cried. ""Didn't they feed him snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn it!"" But this is worse than I expected, and the devil knows I wasn't optimistic! I ordered the trembling, helpless child to go downstairs and into the house."
"He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come hither' he hid his face on my shoulder and wept. 'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. 'None of that nonsense! We're not going to hurt thee, Linton - isn't that thy name? Thou art thy mother's child, entirely! Where is my share in thee, puling chicken?' He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector. 'Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble. 'No,' said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear. 'You've heard of me, I daresay?' 'No,' he replied again. 'No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me! You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. Now, don't wince, and colour up! Though it is something to see you have not white blood.","He didn't quite understand his father's words, or even whether they were directed at him. He wasn't yet sure if this grim, mocking stranger was his father. But he clung to me with growing fear; and when Mr. Heathcliff sat up and commanded him, ""Come here!"" he buried his face in my shoulder and wept. ""Touhou!"" said Heathcliff, reaching out, pulling him roughly between his knees, and then lifting his head by the chin. ""No joke! We won't hurt you, Linton—is that your name? You're every inch your mother's son! What's my part, clever fellow?"" He took off the boy's cap and brushed back his thick blond curls, feeling his thin arms and little fingers. During this inspection, Linton stopped crying and raised his large blue eyes to scrutinize the inspector. ""Do you recognize me?"" "" asked Heathcliff, after assuring himself that all his limbs were equally frail and weak. ""No,"" replied Linton, looking alarmed. ""I suppose you've heard of me?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""No! What a shame for your mother that she never awakened your filial affection for me! You are my son, I can tell you, and your mother was a real bitch when she told you what sort of father you had. Now don't start trembling and dyeing your hair! Although it is something to see that you have no white blood."""
"Be a good lad; and I'll do for you. Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you'll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled while you linger about it.' 'Well,' replied I, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you'll not keep him long; and he's all you have akin in the wide world, that you will ever know - remember.' 'I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing. 'Only nobody else must be kind to him: I'm jealous of monopolising his affection.","Be good, I'll take care of it. Nelly, if you're tired, you can sit down; if not, go home. I hope you'll report what you see and hear to the secretary at the Grange; the matter won't be settled until you've thought it over. ""Well,"" I replied, ""I hope you're kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you won't have him long; and that's all you have in the wide world of acquaintance, as far as you know—don't forget that."" ""I'll be very kind to him, you needn't be afraid,"" he laughed. ""But no one else needs to be kind to him: I'm jealous of claiming his affections for myself."""
"And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,' he added, when they had departed, 'my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor.","And first of all, Joseph, bring the boy breakfast. Hareton, you damned calf, get to work. ""Yes, Nell,"" he added as he left, ""my son is the future owner of your property, and I don't want him to die before I'm sure he'll be his successor."""
"Besides, he's MINE, and I want the triumph of seeing MY descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers' lands for wages. That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient: he's as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles' distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.","Besides, he belongs to me, and I long for the triumph of my descendant, who will become lord and master of his lands; my child hires his children to work for hire on their fathers' lands. That is the only reason I tolerate this boy: I despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he evokes in me! But this consideration is enough: he is safe with me and will be cared for with the same care that your master cares for his own house. I have a room upstairs, beautifully furnished, for him; I have also engaged a tutor who comes three times a week from about thirty kilometers away to teach him everything he wishes to learn."
"I've ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I've arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!' While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk- porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour. 'Cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. 'But Maister Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little 'un; and what wer gooid enough for him's gooid enough for ye, I's rayther think!' 'I SHA'N'T eat it!' answered Linton, snappishly. 'Take it away.' Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us. 'Is there aught ails th' victuals?' he asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff's nose. 'What should ail them?' he said. 'Wah!' answered Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em.","I commanded Hareton to obey him and did everything I could to maintain his superiority and mastery over his colleague. I regret, however, that he is so little worthy of this trouble: if ever I wished to bestow upon him a blessing, it was to find in him a worthy pride; and I am deeply disappointed in this pale, whiny wretch! While he was speaking, Joseph returned with a bowl of porridge and set it before Linton. He stirred the meager mixture with disgust, protesting that he could not eat it. I saw that the old servant shared his master's contempt for the child; though he was forced to keep it to himself, for Heathcliff evidently thought his inferiors held him in high esteem. ""Can't he eat?"" he repeated, staring at Linton and lowering his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard. ""But Master Hareton ate nothing else as a boy; and what suited him will suit you, I suppose!"" ""I won't eat it!"" ""Take it away!"" Linton retorted sharply. ""Take it away."" Joseph indignantly snatched the food and brought it to us. ""Is there anything wrong with this food?"" he asked, holding it under Heathcliff's nose. ""What's the matter?"" he asked. ""Phew!"" Joseph replied, ""the fine fellow says he can't eat it."""
"But I guess it's raight! His mother wer just soa - we wer a'most too mucky to sow t' corn for makking her breead.' 'Don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily. 'Get him something that he can eat, that's all. What is his usual food, Nelly?' I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may contribute to his comfort.","But I think it's true! His mother was the same: We were almost too dirty to sow the grain for his bread. ""Don't tell me about his mother,"" the man said angrily. ""Just give him something to eat. What does he usually eat, Nelly?"" I suggested boiled milk or tea, and the housekeeper was instructed to make some. Well, I thought, his father's selfishness might well contribute to his well-being."
"He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I'll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.","He is aware of his fragility and knows that he must be treated with tolerance. I go to comfort Mr. Edgar by explaining to him how Heathcliff's mood has changed. Since I have no reason to stay longer, I sneak away, while Linton timidly rebuffs the advances of a friendly German Shepherd."
"But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words 'Don't leave me! I'll not stay here! I'll not stay here!' Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended. WE had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if I can get him'; and there were no hopes of that.","But he was too watchful to be deceived: just as I was closing the door, I heard a cry and a desperate repetition of the words: ""Don't leave me! I won't stay here! I won't stay here!"" Then the bolt opened and shut: they wouldn't let him out. I mounted Minny and set her trotting; thus ended my short watch. That day we had a sad task with little Cathy: she rose full of joy, eager to go to her cousin, and the news of his departure excited such passionate tears and wailing that Edgar himself had to console her by saying he would soon return; but he added, ""When I get him back""; and there was no more hope."
"This promise poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him. When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome inmate.","This promise hardly reassured her; but time was stronger. And although she still occasionally asked her father when Linton would return, his features were so blurred in her memory that she no longer recognized him. Whenever I met the housekeeper from Wuthering Heights on a business trip to Gimmerton, I inquired after the young gentleman; he lived almost as withdrawn as Catherine herself and was never seen. I concluded that he was still in poor health and a troublesome resident."
"She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort. 'And I never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor one so careful of hisseln. He WILL go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the evening.","She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to like him less and less, although he tried to hide it: he detested the sound of his voice and absolutely could not bear to sit in the same room with him for hours on end. They rarely spoke: Linton studied and spent his evenings in a small room they called the parlor, or he lay in bed all day, constantly plagued by coughs, colds, aches, and all sorts of ailments. ""And I have never known such a coward,"" the woman added, ""nor such a cautious person. He will continue if I leave the window open a little longer in the evening."""
"Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever - heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him - Hareton is not bad-natured, though he's rough they're sure to part, one swearing and the other crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him up-stairs directly.' I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with us.","Oh! It's murderous, a breath of night air! And he has to light a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's tobacco pipe is poison; and he always needs sweets and dainties and milk, always, milk forever—no matter how straitened we are in the winter; and he'll be sitting there, wrapped in his fur coat, in his armchair by the fire, with toast and water or something on the fire to sip; and when Hareton comes for him out of pity—Hareton is not bad, though he is brutal—they are bound to part, one cursing, the other weeping. I think the Lord would be pleased to have Earnshaw muffle him, if he weren't his son; and I'm sure he could send him away if he knew half a thing or two about how to get around. But then he won't be tempted: he'll never enter the parlor, and if Linton behaved like that in the house where he is, he'd send him upstairs at once. From this story, I concluded that young Heathcliff's lack of compassion had made him selfish and unpleasant, even if he wasn't originally so. My interest in him faded like snow in the sun. Yet I still felt sorry for him and wished he would stay with us."
"Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she lives there still. Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy reached sixteen.","Mr. Edgar encouraged me to inquire. I think he thought highly of him and would have taken the risk of meeting him. One day he recommended that I ask the housekeeper if he had ever been to the village. She told me he had only been there twice, on horseback, with his father. And both times he had pretended to be pregnant for three or four days. This housekeeper left the village, if I remember correctly, two years after his arrival. Another, whom I did not know, took her place. She still lives there today. Time passed as before on the estate, entirely at his pleasure, until Miss Cathy was sixteen."
"On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.","We didn't show the slightest joy on her birthday, as it was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Her father always spent the day alone in the library and, at sunset, went to Gimmerton Cemetery, where he often stayed until after midnight. So Catherine could entertain herself."
"This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour. 'So make haste, Ellen!' she cried. 'I know where I wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made their nests yet.' 'That must be a good distance up,' I answered; 'they don't breed on the edge of the moor.' 'No, it's not,' she said. 'I've gone very near with papa.' I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.","That 20th of March was a fine spring day, and after her father had left, my young wife, dressed for going out, came downstairs and told me she wanted to take me for a walk along the edge of the moor. Mr. Linton had given her permission, on condition that we go only a short distance and be back within the hour. ""Then hurry, Ellen!"" she cried. ""I know where I'm going: to where a colony of moor deer has settled. I want to see if they've built any nests."" ""It must be far,"" I answered. ""They don't nest on the edge of the moor."" ""No, they don't,"" she said. ""I was very close by with my father."" I put on my hat and set off without hesitation. She bounded ahead of me, came back to me, and then rose again like a young greyhound; And at first, I found it wonderful to listen to the song of the larks everywhere and to enjoy the gentle, warm sunshine, but also to look at her, my darling and my happiness, with her golden curls falling freely over her back, her radiant cheeks as soft and pure as a wild rose, and her eyes shining with cloudless joy. She was a joyful creature, an angel, then."
"It's a pity she could not be content. 'Well,' said I, 'where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.' 'Oh, a little further - only a little further, Ellen,' was her answer, continually. 'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.' But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.","It's a pity she's not satisfied. 'Well,' I said, 'where's your heath, Miss Cathy? We ought to be there: the Grange Park fence is still a long way off.' 'Oh, a little more, just a little more, Ellen,' she kept saying. 'Up the hill, over the bank, and when you're on the other side, I'll have rounded up the birds.' But there were so many hills and banks to climb and cross that at last I grew tired of it and told her we must stop and go back. I called to her, for she was a long way ahead; she didn't hear me or take any notice, for she jumped on her horse anyway, and I felt obliged to follow her. At last she dipped into a hollow; and before I saw her again she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own house; and I saw people stopping her. I was convinced one of them was Mr. Heathcliff himself."
"Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he was reproving the poacher. 'I've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. 'I didn't mean to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to see the eggs.' Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards it, and demanded who 'papa' was? 'Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied. 'I thought you did not know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.' 'You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?' he said, sarcastically. 'And what are you?' inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker. 'That man I've seen before. Is he your son?' She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever. 'Miss Cathy,' I interrupted, 'it will be three hours instead of one that we are out, presently.","Cathy had been caught looting, or at least destroying, the grouse nests. The Heights belonged to Heathcliff, and he rebuked the poacher. ""I didn't take any, nor did I find any,"" she said, as I struggled, holding out my hands to confirm her statement. ""I wasn't going to take any, but Papa told me there were plenty here, and I wanted to see the eggs."" Heathcliff looked at me with a nasty grin—a sign of his familiarity with the group and therefore his hostility toward them—and asked who ""Pa"" was. ""Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,"" she replied. ""I thought you didn't know me, or you wouldn't have spoken like that."" ""Then you think Papa is highly valued and respected?"" he asked sarcastically. ""And who are you?"" Catherine asked, looking curiously at the speaker. ""I've seen this man before. Is he your son?"" She pointed to Hareton, the other person, who had only gained mass and strength in two years. He still seemed as clumsy and brutal as ever. ""Miss Cathy,"" I interrupted, ""we'll be there in three hours instead of one."""
"We really must go back.' 'No, that man is not my son,' answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside. 'But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house? You'll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind welcome.' I whispered Catherine that she mustn't, on any account, accede to the proposal: it was entirely out of the question. 'Why?' she asked, aloud. 'I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy: I can't sit here. Let us go, Ellen.","We really must go back. ""No, that man is not my son,"" Heathcliff replied, pushing me away. ""But I do have one, and you've seen him before. And although your nurse is in a hurry, I think you both could use a little rest. Could you walk around this corner of the heath and come to me? Then you'll be home early and receive a warm welcome."" I whispered to Catherine that she must not accept the suggestion; it was out of the question. ""Why?"" she asked loudly. ""I'm tired of walking, and the ground is covered with dew. I can't stay here. Let's go, Ellen."""
"Besides, he says I have seen his son. He's mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone' Crags. Don't you?' 'I do.","He also says I saw his son. I think he's mistaken, but I suspect he lives there: on the farm I visited on my way back from Penistone Crags. Don't you?"
"Come, Nelly, hold your tongue - it will he a treat for her to look in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me, Nelly.' 'No, she's not going to any such place,' I cried, struggling to release my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones already, scampering round the brow at full speed.","Come, Nelly, be quiet, she'll be happy to see us. Hareton, go with the girl. You'll come with me, Nelly. ""No, she won't go to a place like that,"" I cried, trying to free my arm from his grasp. But she was almost at the threshold, turning the corner at full speed."
"Her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side, and vanished. 'Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,' I continued: 'you know you mean no good. And there she'll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever we return; and I shall have the blame.' 'I want her to see Linton,' he answered; 'he's looking better these few days; it's not often he's fit to be seen. And we'll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?' 'The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so,' I replied. 'My design is as honest as possible.","Her companion made no pretense of accompanying her; he walked down the street and disappeared. ""Mr. Heathcliff, everything is wrong,"" I continued. ""You don't mean well. And there she will see Linton, and everything will be discussed as soon as we get back; and I will take responsibility."" ""I want her to see Linton,"" he replied. ""He's been looking better lately; he's not often seen. And we'll quickly persuade her to keep this visit a secret: what's the harm?"" ""The trouble is, her father would hate me if he knew I allowed her into your house; and I'm convinced you don't mean well in persuading her to do so,"" I replied. ""My intention is as sincere as can be."""
"I'll inform you of its whole scope,' he said. 'That the two cousins may fall in love, and get married. I'm acting generously to your master: his young chit has no expectations, and should she second my wishes she'll be provided for at once as joint successor with Linton.' 'If Linton died,' I answered, 'and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine would be the heir.' 'No, she would not,' he said. 'There is no clause in the will to secure it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire their union, and am resolved to bring it about.' 'And I'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,' I returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming. Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to open the door.","""I will inform you of the whole matter,"" he said. ""The two cousins should fall in love and marry. I am generous to your master: his young daughter has no expectations, and if she complies with my wishes, she will be provided for at once as Linton's co-heir."" ""If Linton were to die,"" I replied, ""and his life were entirely uncertain, Catherine would be the heir."" ""No, she would not,"" he said. ""There is no clause in the will guaranteeing this: her estate would go to me; but to avoid quarrels, I desire their union and am determined to bring it about."" ""And I am determined that she will never come with me to your house again,"" I replied as we reached the gate where Miss Cathy was waiting for us. Heathcliff begged me to be silent, led us up the path, and hurried to open the door."
"My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes.","My young wife looked at him several times as if she didn't quite know what to make of him; but now he smiled when he looked at her and spoke to her in a gentler voice; and I was foolish enough to believe that the memory of his mother would keep him from wishing her ill. Linton stood by the fire. He was walking across the fields, for he had his cap on his head, and called to Joseph to bring him dry shoes."
"He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun. 'Now, who is that?' asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. 'Can you tell?' 'Your son?' she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the other. 'Yes, yes,' answered he: 'but is this the only time you have beheld him? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don't you recall your cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?' 'What, Linton!' cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name. 'Is that little Linton? He's taller than I am! Are you Linton?' The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each.","He had grown considerably for his age, only a few months and sixteen years. His features were still handsome, and his eyes and complexion shone brighter than I remembered, only a slight sparkle brought about by the pure air and mild sunshine. ""Who is he?"" asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. ""Do you see him?"" ""Your son?"" she said, after looking doubtfully from one to the other. ""Yes, yes,"" he answered, ""but is that the only time you've seen him? Think! Ah! You have a short memory. Linton, don't you remember your cousin, how you were always teasing us about seeing him again?"" ""What, Linton!"" cried Cathy, delightedly surprised at the name. ""Is that little Linton? He's bigger than I am! Are you Linton?"" The young man stepped forward and confessed: She kissed him tenderly, and they watched with amazement the change that time had wrought in her appearance."
"Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton's looks and movements were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the former alone. 'And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him. 'I thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.","Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was at once plump and slender, with the elasticity of steel, and her whole appearance radiated health and vitality. Linton's look and movements were marked by great languor, and his figure extremely slender; yet the grace of his manner mitigated these defects and did not make him unpleasant. After exchanging many tokens of affection, her nephew went to Mr. Heathcliff, who stood at the door, dividing his attention between the things within and those without: pretending to notice the latter, but in reality noticing only the former. ""And you are my uncle!"" she cried, looking up to greet him. ""I thought I liked you, though you were angry at first."""
"Why don't you visit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?' 'I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered. 'There - damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton: they are thrown away on me.' 'Naughty Ellen!' exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses. 'Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But I'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes bring papa. Won't you be glad to see us?' 'Of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace, resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. 'But stay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady. 'Now I think of it, I'd better tell you.","Why don't you go with Linton to the Grange? Being such close neighbors all these years and never seeing each other is strange: why did you do that? ""I went there once or twice too often before you were born,"" he replied. ""Goodness! If you have any kisses left, give them to Linton; they're wasted on me."" ""Naughty Ellen!"" cried Catherine, showering me with generous caresses. ""Naughty Ellen! She wants to keep me out. But from now on, I'll take this walk every morning: may I, Uncle? And sometimes I'll take Papa. Wouldn't you be glad to see us?"" ""Of course,"" replied the uncle with a barely suppressed grimace born of his deep dislike for the two proposed visitors. ""But wait,"" he continued, turning to the young woman. ""Now that I think about it, I'd better tell you."""
"Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if you mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must not mention it.' 'Why did you quarrel?' asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen. 'He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.' 'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so. But Linton and I have no share in your quarrel.","Mr. Linton is prejudiced against me: we quarreled once in our lives with unchristian violence; and if you tell him you are coming here, he will forbid your visits altogether. Therefore, do not speak of it unless you wish to avoid seeing your cousin in the future: you may come if you wish, but you must not speak of it. ""Why did you quarrel?"" asked Catherine, very distressed. ""He thought I was too poor to marry his sister,"" replied Heathcliff, ""and was sorry I had her; his pride was wounded, and he will never forgive me."" ""It is wrong!"" said the young woman. ""I will tell him someday. But Linton and I had nothing to do with your quarrel."""
"I'll not come here, then; he shall come to the Grange.' 'It will be too far for me,' murmured her cousin: 'to walk four miles would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or twice a week.' The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt. 'I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,' he muttered to me. 'Miss Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton! - Do you know that, twenty times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I'd have loved the lad had he been some one else.","Then I won't come here; he'll come to the manor. ""That would be too far for me,"" murmured his cousin. ""Six kilometers would be the limit. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or twice a week."" The father gave his son a look of bitter contempt. ""I'm afraid, Nelly, of losing my job,"" he murmured. ""Miss Catherine, as that fool calls her, will see his worth and send him to the devil. If it were Hareton! Do you know that, for all his degradation, I desire Hareton twenty times a day? I would have loved the boy if he had been anyone else."""
"But I think he's safe from HER love. I'll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.","But I think he's safe from his love. I'll confront him about this puny creature if he doesn't do something soon. I'd guess he's barely eighteen."
"Oh, confound the vapid thing! He's absorbed in drying his feet, and never looks at her. - Linton!' 'Yes, father,' answered the boy. 'Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.' 'Wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again. 'I don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and evidently eager to be active. He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for Hareton.","Oh, my goodness, what nonsense! He's quite busy wiping his feet and doesn't even look at her. ""Linton!"" ""Yes, Father,"" answered the boy. ""Have you nothing to show your niece, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest? Take her into the garden before you change her shoes, and into the stable to see your horse."" ""Wouldn't you rather stay here?"" asked Linton, turning to Cathy in a tone that expressed his reluctance to move. ""I don't know,"" she answered, with a longing look towards the door, evidently eager to be going. He remained seated and moved closer to the fire. Heathcliff got up, went into the kitchen, then into the yard, and called Hareton."
"Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair. 'Oh, I'll ask YOU, uncle,' cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the housekeeper's assertion. 'That is not my cousin, is he?' 'Yes,' he, replied, 'your mother's nephew. Don't you like him!' Catherine looked queer. 'Is he not a handsome lad?' he continued.","Hareton answered, and a moment later they returned. The young man was washing, as his shining cheeks and wet hair testified. ""Oh, I'm asking you, Uncle,"" cried Miss Cathy, remembering the governess's assertion. ""He's not my cousin, is he?"" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""your mother's cousin. Don't you think he's nice?"" Catherine looked at him, puzzled. ""Isn't he a handsome fellow?"" he asked."
"The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in Heathcliff's ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming 'You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a - What was it? Well, something very flattering.","The rude man stood on tiptoe and whispered something in Heathcliff's ear. He laughed; Hareton's expression darkened: ""I've noticed that he's very sensitive to suspicious insults and evidently has a vague sense of inferiority."" But his master or guardian dispelled his frown with the exclamation, ""You'll be our favorite, Hareton! She says you're—"" What? Well, something very complimentary."
"Here! you go with her round the farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don't use any bad words; and don't stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly, and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as nicely as you can.' He watched the couple walking past the window.","""Here! Go with her to the farm. And behave like a gentleman! Don't swear; don't stare at the young lady if she isn't looking at you, and be prepared to hide your face if she is; and when you speak, speak slowly and don't put your hands in your pockets. Go away and treat her as kindly as possible."" He watched the couple pass by the window."
"Earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest. Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.","Earnshaw turned his face completely away from his companion. He seemed to be observing the familiar landscape with the interest of a stranger and artist. Catherine gave him a mischievous glance and expressed mild admiration."
"She then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation. 'I've tied his tongue,' observed Heathcliff. 'He'll not venture a single syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect meat his age - nay, some years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ""gaumless,"" as Joseph calls it?' 'Worse,' I replied, 'because more sullen with it.' 'I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud. 'He has satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much.","Then she devoted herself to finding distraction, trotting merrily along while singing a song to make up for the lack of entertainment. ""I've tied his tongue,"" Heathcliff remarked. ""He doesn't even dare utter a syllable! Nelly, do you remember how old he is—no, a few years younger. Have I ever looked so stupid, as 'stupid,' as Joseph says?"" ""Worse,"" I replied, ""because it makes me even grumpier."" ""I enjoy the sight of him,"" he continued, thinking aloud. ""He has lived up to my expectations. If he had been born stupid, I wouldn't be so pleased."""
"But he's no fool; and I can sympathise with all his feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer, though. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance.","But he's not stupid; and I can understand all his feelings because I've experienced them myself. For example, I know exactly what he's going through right now: It's just the beginning of what he's going through. And he'll never be able to escape his pathetic rudeness and ignorance."
"I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I've taught him to scorn everything extra- animal as silly and weak. Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as proud as I am of mine.","I caught him faster than his infamous father caught me, and even deeper; for he prides himself on his brutality. I taught him to despise everything that isn't bestial, and to consider it stupid and weak. Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him? Almost as proud as I am of mine."
"But there's this difference; one is gold put to the use of paving- stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver. MINE has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. HIS had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.","But there is a difference: one is gold, used for paving stones; the other is polished tin, imitating silverware. Mine has nothing precious about it; yet I shall have the merit of bringing it as far as such a wretched thing can. His had first-class qualities, and these have been lost: worse than useless."
"I have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!' Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.","I regret nothing; he would regret more than anyone but me. And best of all, Hareton loves me infinitely! You'll admit I've surpassed Hindley in that. If that dead villain could rise from his grave and accuse me of the misdeeds of his descendants, I would have the pleasure of seeing them fight against him, outraged that he dares to rant against the only friend he has in the world! Heathcliff grinned devilishly at the thought."
"I made no reply, because I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of Catherine's society for fear of a little fatigue. His father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap. 'Get up, you idle boy!' he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. 'Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.' Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.","I didn't answer, as he hadn't expected it. Our young companion, who was sitting too far away to hear what was being said, was beginning to feel ill, probably because he had neglected Catherine's company for fear of fatigue. His father noticed the anxious glances towards the window and the uncertain man taking off his cap. ""Get up, you lazybones!"" he cried with mock cordiality. ""Get them! They're just around the corner, by the beehives."" Linton recovered and left the fireplace."
"The lattice was open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and scratched his head like a true clown. 'It's some damnable writing,' he answered. 'I cannot read it.' 'Can't read it?' cried Catherine; 'I can read it: it's English. But I want to know why it is there.' Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited. 'He does not know his letters,' he said to his cousin. 'Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?' 'Is he all as he should be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he simple: not right? I've questioned him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly understand him, I'm sure!' Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment. 'There's nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?' he said. 'My cousin fancies you are an idiot.","The gate stood open, and as he went out, I heard Cathy ask her unsociable maid what that writing above the door was. Hareton looked up and scratched his head like a clown. ""That's some damned good handwriting,"" he answered. ""I can't read it."" ""I can't read it?"" cried Catherine. ""I can read it: it's English. But I wonder what it's for."" Linton sneered: this was his first sign of amusement. ""He doesn't know the alphabet,"" he said to his cousin. ""Would you believe in the existence of such a colossal fool?"" ""Is he quite as he ought to be?"" asked Miss Cathy earnestly. ""Or is he merely ill? I've asked him twice, and each time he's looked so stupid that I don't think he understands me."" ""I can hardly understand, I'm sure!"" Linton repeated his laugh and looked mockingly at Hareton, who genuinely didn't seem to understand him at the moment. ""It's just laziness, isn't it, Earnshaw?"" he said. ""My cousin thinks you're an idiot."""
"There you experience the consequence of scorning ""book-larning,"" as you would say. Have you noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?' 'Why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled Hareton, more ready in answering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement. 'Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered Linton. 'Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without one.","Now you're suffering the consequences of your contempt for ""reading,"" as you would call it. Have you noticed his terrible Yorkshire accent, Catherine? ""Well, what's that all about?"" growled Hareton, answering his daily companion with increasing impatience. He was about to continue when the two young people burst into peals of laughter. My mistress, a little boisterous, was delighted to discover that she might be able to turn his strange language into a source of amusement. ""What's that phrase all about?"" sneered Linton. ""Father told you not to use foul language, and without it you can't open your mouth."""
"Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!' 'If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I would; pitiful lath of a crater!' retorted the angry boor, retreating, while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he was conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it. Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the door-way: the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults and deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.","""Now, try to behave like a gentleman!"" ""If you were no more a girl than a boy, I would beat you on the spot, you poor little thing!"" retorted the furious farmer, stepping back, his face burning with anger and resentment! For he was conscious of the insult and ashamed to be angry about it. Mr. Heathcliff, who, like me, had been listening to the conversation, smiled as he saw him go, but immediately cast a look of curious disgust at the frivolous couple who continued chatting on the threshold. The boy amused himself greatly in discussing Hareton's faults and weaknesses and in relating anecdotes of his exploits; and the girl enjoyed his bold and sharp remarks, oblivious to the malice they showed. I began to hate Linton more than to sympathize with him, and in a way excused his father for thinking him mean."
"We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them. 'Aha!' she cried, 'you take papa's side, Ellen: you are partial I know; or else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that Linton lived a long way from here. I'm really extremely angry; only I'm so pleased I can't show it! But you must hold your tongue about MY uncle; he's my uncle, remember; and I'll scold papa for quarrelling with him.' And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake.","We stayed until twelve o'clock. I could not persuade Miss Cathy to leave earlier. But fortunately, my master had not left his lodgings and knew nothing of our long absence. On my return, I would have liked to have informed my ward about the character of the people we had left behind. But she thought I was prejudiced against her. ""Ah!"" she cried. ""You take Papa's side, Ellen. You are partial, I know. Otherwise, you would not have deceived me for so many years by imagining Linton to live far away. I am really terribly angry. Only, I am so glad I can hide it from my face! But you must keep quiet about my uncle. He is my uncle, remember that. And I shall scold Papa for quarreling with him."" And so she went on until I gave up all attempts to convince her of her error."
"She did not mention the visit that night, because she did not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will. 'Papa!' she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, 'guess whom I saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors.","She didn't mention the evening visit, as she hadn't seen Mr. Linton. The next day, to my great regret, everything was revealed to me; and yet I didn't regret it: I thought he could assume the responsibility of guiding and warning her better than I could. But he was too timid to justify his desire that she should stay away from the house in the Heights, and Catherine loved good reasons for any restriction that tormented her dear will. ""Papa!"" she cried after the morning greeting, ""guess whom I saw yesterday on my walk on the moor."""
"Ah, papa, you started! you've not done right, have you, now? I saw - but listen, and you shall hear how I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about Linton's coming back!' She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew why he had concealed Linton's near neighbourhood from her? Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy? 'It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,' she answered. 'Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?' he said. 'No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton again.","Ah, papa, you started it! You haven't done it yet, have you? I saw it, but listen, and you'll know how I caught you; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to feel so much pity for me, while I was always hoping for Linton's return, and was always disappointed! She faithfully related her excursion and its consequences to me; and my master, though he gave me more than one reproachful look, said nothing until she had finished. Then, drawing her close, he asked her if she knew why he had deprived her of Linton's retinue. Could she think he meant to deprive her of a pleasure she might innocently have enjoyed? ""It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,"" she answered. ""Then you think I care more for my own feelings than for yours, Cathy?"" he said. ""No, it wasn't because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; he is a most wicked man who delights in hurting and ruining those he hates, given the slightest chance. I knew you couldn't maintain contact with your cousin without coming into contact with him; and I knew he would hate you for my sake. Therefore, for your own good, and no other reason, I made arrangements to ensure that you never come to Linton again."""
"I meant to explain this some time as you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.' 'But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at all convinced; 'and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella. And you won't. YOU are the one to be blamed: he is willing to let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.' My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.","I wanted to explain this to you when you were older, and I'm sorry I've put it off."" ""But Mr. Heathcliff was very kind, Papa,"" remarked Catherine, not at all convinced; ""and he didn't mind our seeing each other. He said I could come to him whenever I liked. Only I couldn't tell you because you quarreled with him and haven't forgiven him for marrying Aunt Isabella. And you won't. It's your fault: at least he wants Linton and me to remain friends, and not you."" My master, seeing that she did not believe in her uncle's bad nature, quickly described his behavior towards Isabella and how Wuthering Heights had fallen to her."
"He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton's death. 'She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy - conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed - was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature - excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now - that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject.","He could not bear to linger on the subject; for, though he spoke little of it, he still felt for his old enemy the same loathing and disgust which had gripped him since Mrs. Linton's death. ""She might have lived, but for him!"" he repeated constantly and bitterly; and in his eyes, Heathcliff looked like a murderer. Miss Cathy, who knew no other evil deeds than her own little acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, born of her irritability and unconsciousness, and which she repented the same day, was amazed at the darkness of mind which could entertain and conceal thoughts of revenge for years, and carry out its plans resolutely and without a tinge of remorse. She seemed so deeply impressed and shocked by this new view of human nature—which had hitherto been excluded from all her studies and ideas—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject further."
"He merely added: 'You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.' Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her crying, on her knees by the bedside. 'Oh, fie, silly child!' I exclaimed. 'If you had any real griefs you'd be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of coveting more.' 'I'm not crying for myself, Ellen,' she answered, 'it's for him.","He simply added: ""You will learn later, my dear, why I want you to avoid his house and his family. Now go back to your pursuits and pleasures and think no more of it."" Catherine kissed her father and, as usual, sat quietly for a few hours, listening to his lessons; then she accompanied him to the park, and the day passed as usual. But when she retired to her room in the evening, and I went to help her undress, I found her kneeling weeping beside his bed. ""Oh dear, what a fool!"" I cried. ""If you were truly sad, you would be ashamed to shed a tear over this little contradiction. You have never felt the slightest sadness, Miss Catherine. Imagine that my master and I were dead and you were alone in the world: how would you feel then? Compare the present situation to such an ordeal, and be grateful to your friends instead of wishing for more."" “I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she replied, “I’m crying for him.”"
"He expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed: and he'll wait for me, and I sha'n't come!' 'Nonsense!' said I, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him? Hasn't he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no further about you.' 'But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?' she asked, rising to her feet. 'And just send those books I promised to lend him? His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not, Ellen?' 'No, indeed! no, indeed!' replied I with decision. 'Then he would write to you, and there'd never be an end of it.","He was hoping to see me tomorrow, and he'll be so disappointed! He'll be waiting for me, and I won't come!' 'Nonsense!' I said. 'Do you think he loves you as much as you love him? Doesn't he have Hareton for company? Not one person in a hundred would mourn the loss of a relative he'd just seen twice in two afternoons. Linton will guess why, and then he'll never notice you again.' 'But can't I write him a few lines and tell him why I can't come?' she asked, getting up. 'And just send him the books I promised to lend him? His books aren't as beautiful as mine, and he was so keen to have them when I told him how interesting they were. Weren't you, Ellen?' 'No, absolutely! Absolutely!' I answered firmly. 'Then he'd write to you, and there'd be no end to the matter.'"
"No, Miss Catherine, the acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see that it is done.' 'But how can one little note - ?' she recommenced, putting on an imploring countenance. 'Silence!' I interrupted. 'We'll not begin with your little notes. Get into bed.' She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance. 'You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine,' I said, 'if you write it; and at present I shall put out your candle.' I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my hand and a petulant 'cross thing!' I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk- fetcher who came from the village; but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards.","No, Miss Catherine, we must stop all performances altogether: Papa expects it, and I will see to it. ""But how are we going to write this down—"" she continued imploringly. ""Hush!"" I interrupted. ""We are not going to start your notes. Go to bed."" She gave me a very spiteful look, so spiteful that at first I didn't want to kiss her goodnight. I tucked her in and closed the door angrily; but, half-repentant, I quietly went back, and there it was! Mademoiselle was standing at the table, a blank sheet of paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily disappeared as I came in. ""No one will accept this, Catherine,"" I said, ""if you write it down; and I'll put out your candle now."" I held the fire extinguisher on the fire and received a slap on the hand and a surly ""Angry!"" I left her again, and she bolted the door in one of her worst, most ill-tempered moods. The letter was completed and forwarded to the addressee by a village milkman; however, I learned of it only later."
"Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it. One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper.","Over the weeks, Cathy recovered. However, she developed a strange penchant for hiding in corners by herself. When I approached her while she was reading, she would often jump up and bend over the book, obviously intent on hiding it. Then I would notice loose sheets of paper sticking out of the pages. She also had a habit of coming downstairs early in the morning and loitering in the kitchen as if waiting for something. She had a small drawer in a bookshelf that she would fiddle with for hours, carefully removing the key each time she left. One day, as she was inspecting this drawer, I noticed that the toys and knick-knacks that had recently been in it had become folded pieces of paper."
"My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence - daily almost, it must have been - from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by her.","My curiosity and suspicion were aroused; I decided to take a look at her mysterious treasures. That evening, when she and my master had safely arrived upstairs, I searched for a suitable key for the lock and soon found it among my house keys. After opening the key, I poured the entire contents into my apron and carried it to my room to examine it in peace. Although I couldn't suppress my suspicions, I was nevertheless astonished to discover that they were a wealth of letters—no doubt almost daily—from Linton Heathcliff: replies to documents she had sent me."
"The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious love- letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.","The previously dated letters were embarrassingly short; yet they gradually developed into voluptuous, absurd love letters, appropriate to the writer's age, though with a few hints that I suspected had been borrowed from a more experienced source. Some struck me as particularly odd, a mixture of passion and superficiality; they began with strong emotions and ended in the affected, verbose style a schoolboy might display toward a spoiled, superficial lover. I don't know if Cathy appreciated them; in any case, they seemed like empty words to me."
"After turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer. Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's affectionate composition.","After looking through as many as I thought necessary, I wrapped them in a handkerchief, laid them aside, and closed the empty drawer. As was her custom, my young wife went downstairs early and visited the kitchen: I saw her open the door as a certain little boy arrived; and while the milkmaid was filling his eyes, she put something into her coat pocket and took something out. I walked through the garden and waited for the messenger; he bravely defended his confidence, and we spilled the milk between us; but I managed to summarize the letter; and, under threat of serious consequences if he disregarded it, I stood under the wall and read Miss Cathy's touching essay."
"It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin's: very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.","It was simpler and more eloquent than her cousin's: very beautiful and very funny. I shook my head and went home to meditate. Since it was raining, she couldn't enjoy a walk in the park; so after her morning studies, she sought refuge in the cozy drawer."
"Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up. 'What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?' he said.","Her father was sitting at the table reading; I had deliberately tried to occupy a few untouched edges of the curtain while I watched his activities attentively. Never had a bird returning to a plundered nest, which it had left full of twittering young, expressed its despairing cries and flapping of wings with such intensity as she did, with her single ""Oh!"" and the change that had come over her once cheerful face. Mr. Linton looked up. ""What is the matter, my dear? Are you hurt?"" he asked."
"His tone and look assured her HE had not been the discoverer of the hoard. 'No, papa!' she gasped. 'Ellen! Ellen! come up-stairs - I'm sick!' I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out. 'Oh, Ellen! you have got them,' she commenced immediately, dropping on her knees, when we were enclosed alone. 'Oh, give them to me, and I'll never, never do so again! Don't tell papa. You have not told papa, Ellen? say you have not? I've been exceedingly naughty, but I won't do it any more!' With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up. 'So,' I exclaimed, 'Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems: you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it's good enough to be printed! And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him? I hav'n't shown it yet, but you needn't imagine I shall keep your ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I'm certain.' 'I didn't! I didn't!' sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. 'I didn't once think of loving him till - ' 'LOVING!' cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word. 'LOVING! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.","Her tone and her look assured him that he hadn't discovered the treasure. ""No, Papa!"" she gasped. ""Ellen! Ellen! Come up, I feel sick!"" I obeyed and escorted her outside. ""Oh, Ellen! You've got it,"" she began at once, and fell to her knees when they were alone. ""Oh, give it to me, and I'll never do it again! Don't tell Papa. Didn't you tell Papa, Ellen? You say you haven't? I've been incredibly naughty, but I won't do it again!"" With a stern look, I ordered her to stand up. ""Well,"" I exclaimed, ""Miss Catherine, you seem to have made pretty good progress; you might be ashamed of yourself! You're no doubt studying a nice little volume of nonsense in your spare time; well, it's going to be printed!"" And what will the professor think when I show it to him? I haven't shown it to him yet, but don't you think I keep your ridiculous secrets to myself. Shame on you! And you must have taken the initiative to write such nonsense: he wouldn't have even thought of it, I'm sure.' 'Not me! Not me!' sobbed Cathy, almost inconsolably. 'I never for a moment thought of loving him...' 'LOVE!' I cried with as much contempt as I could muster. 'LOVE! Has anyone ever heard of that? I might as well be talking about love for the miller who comes once a year to buy our grain.'"
"Pretty loving, indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I'm going with it to the library; and we'll see what your father says to such LOVING.' She sprang at her precious epistles, but I hold them above my head; and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them - do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold - for I esteemed it all girlish vanity - I at length relented in a measure, and asked, 'If I consent to burn them, will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings, nor playthings?' 'We don't send playthings,' cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her shame. 'Nor anything at all, then, my lady?' I said. 'Unless you will, here I go.' 'I promise, Ellen!' she cried, catching my dress. 'Oh, put them in the fire, do, do!' But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne.","What words of love! And both times in succession you have only seen Linton for four hours in your life! And here is this childish confusion. I am going with them to the library; and we shall see what your father thinks of such LOVE. She rose abruptly to take her precious letters, but I held them above my head; then she begged me more desperately to burn them—to do more than merely exhibit them. And as I would have laughed as much as scolded—for I considered it all girlish vanity—I finally gave in and asked: ""If I consent to burn them, will you sincerely promise me never to send or receive another letter, book (for I see you have sent her books), lock of hair, rings, or toys?"" ""We will send no toys,"" cried Catherine, whose pride overcame her shame. ""And nothing at all, madam?"" ""I said. ""If you don't want me to do it, I'll go."" ""I promise, Ellen!"" she cried, grabbing my dress. ""Oh, throw her in the fire, do it, do it!"" But when I cleared the way with the poker, the sacrifice was too painful to bear."
"She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her one or two. 'One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!' I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an angle, and the flame curled up the chimney. 'I will have one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting her hand into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense of her fingers. 'Very well - and I will have some to exhibit to papa!' I answered, shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door. She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment.","She begged me to save her one or two. ""One or two, Ellen, for Linton!"" I untied the handkerchief and began tossing them aside, the flame spiraling up the chimney. ""I'll have one, you rascal!"" she cried, reaching into the fire and pulling out a few half-burned pieces of pottery. ""Well, and I'll have some to show Papa!"" I answered, putting the rest back into the bundle and turning towards the door. She threw her blackened pieces of pottery into the flames and signed to me to finish burning them. This was done; I stirred the ashes and buried them under a shovelful of embers; and silent and deeply wounded, she retired to her room."
"I descended to tell my master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn't dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, 'Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.' And, henceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.","I went downstairs to tell my master that the young lady's nausea had almost disappeared, but I thought it best if she lay down for a while. She refused to eat, but reappeared for tea, pale, with red eyes, and a remarkably dejected expression. The next morning, I answered the letter with the inscription: ""Master Heathcliff is requested not to send any further letters to Miss Linton, as she will not receive any."" And from then on, the little boy returned empty-handed."
"SUMMER drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission. Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her reading less, and taking more exercise.","Summer was drawing to a close, and autumn was already beginning: Michaelmas had already passed, but the harvest was late that year, and some of our fields were still unharvested. Mr. Linton and his daughter were regularly out with the reapers; they stayed until dusk to gather the last sheaves, and as the evenings were cold and damp, my master caught a bad cold that clung stubbornly to his lungs and kept him almost continuously indoors all winter. Poor Cathy, frightened by her little love affair, had since become considerably sadder and more gloomy; and her father insisted that she read less and exercise more."
"She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his. On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November - a fresh watery afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds - dark grey streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain - I requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited - and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.","She no longer had his company. I considered it my duty to substitute for his absence, as far as possible, with my own: an ineffective substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours of my many daily duties to retrace his steps, and my company was then decidedly less tempting than his. One afternoon in October or early November—a cool, damp afternoon, with the grass and paths rustling with damp, withered leaves, and the cold, blue sky half-obscured by clouds—dark gray threads rising rapidly from the west and heralding torrential rains—I begged my young lady to break off her walk, as I was sure there would be showers. She refused. and I reluctantly put on a coat and took my umbrella to accompany her on a walk to the end of the park: a formal walk which she generally took, even when it was gloomy—and she invariably took it when Mr. Edgar behaved worse than usual, which she never learned from his confession, but which we both gathered from her increasing silence and the melancholy in her expression."
"She went sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.","She continued sadly: Running or jumping was no longer an option, even though the cold wind might have tempted her to do so. And often I saw with my own eyes how she raised her hand and wiped her cheek. I looked around, looking for a way to distract her."
"On one side of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs - my nursery lore - to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express. 'Look, Miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree. 'Winter is not here yet.","On one side of the road rose a high, precipitous slope, on which stunted hazel bushes and oaks with half-exposed roots lay precariously positioned: the ground was too soft for the latter, and fierce winds had blown some of them almost horizontal. In summer, Miss Catherine loved to climb these trunks and perch in the branches six meters above the ground; and I, charmed by her agility and light, childlike heart, still thought it proper to scold her whenever I surprised her so high up, but only so that she would know it was useless to come down. From dinner until tea, she lay in her cradle rocking in the breeze and did nothing but sing old songs to herself—my nursery tradition—or watch the birds, her roommates, feeding their young and encouraging them to fly away; Or she nested with the lid closed, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express. ""Look, miss!"" I called, pointing to a niche beneath the roots of a gnarled tree. ""Winter isn't here yet."""
"There's a little flower up yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it to show to papa?' Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length - 'No, I'll not touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?' 'Yes,' I observed, 'about as starved and suckless as you your cheeks are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You're so low, I daresay I shall keep up with you.' 'No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face. 'Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder. 'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.' She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by sobs. 'Oh, it will be something worse,' she said. 'And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can't forget your words, Ellen; they are always in my ear.","Above it rises a tiny flower, the last bud of the many bluebells that in July enveloped these lawn steps in a purple haze. ""Will you climb up and pick it to show Papa?"" Cathy stared for a long time at the solitary flower trembling in its earthy shelter, and finally answered, ""No, I won't touch it. But it looks melancholy, doesn't it, Ellen?"" ""Yes,"" I remarked, ""about as starved and famished as you—your cheeks are drained of blood; let's join hands and start walking. You're so dejected, I bet I could keep up with you."" ""No,"" she repeated, and walked leisurely on, pausing now and then to look at a blade of moss, a clump of bleached grass, or a toadstool losing its bright orange hue among the piles of brown leaves; and from time to time she laid her hand on her averted face. ""Catherine, why are you crying, darling?"" I asked, coming to her and putting my arm around her shoulders. ""You mustn't cry because Papa has a cold. Be glad it's not worse."" She couldn't hold back her tears any longer; her breath caught in her throat. ""Oh, it's getting worse,"" she said. ""And what will I do if you and Papa leave me and I'm left alone? I can't forget your words, Ellen; they still ring in my ears."""
"How life will be changed, how dreary the world will be, when papa and you are dead.' 'None can tell whether you won't die before us,' I replied. 'It's wrong to anticipate evil. We'll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five. My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.","How life will change, how dark the world will be when you and Dad are dead. ""No one can predict that you won't die before us,"" I replied. ""It's wrong to predict the worst. We hope that many years will pass before one of us dies: the Lord is young, I am strong and barely forty-five. My mother lived to eighty, a wise woman to the end."""
"And suppose Mr. Linton I were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you have counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?' 'But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation. 'Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied. 'She wasn't as happy as Master: she hadn't as much to live for. All you need do, is to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy! I'll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.' 'I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered my companion. 'I care for nothing in comparison with papa.","And if Mr. Linton were spared until he was sixty, that would be more years than you counted, Miss. And wouldn't it be foolish to mourn a misfortune that happened over twenty years ago? ""But Aunt Isabel was younger than Papa,"" she remarked, looking up with a faint hope for consolation. ""Aunt Isabel had neither you nor me to look after her,"" I replied. ""She wasn't as happy as Master: she didn't have as much to live for. You just have to take good care of your father and comfort him by letting him see you happy; and not worry him: Remember, Cathy! I won't hide it from you, but you could kill him if you were foolish and rash, if you had a foolish and fanciful affection for the son of a woman who would gladly keep him in his grave; and if you let him find out that you were worried about the separation he thought desirable. - ""I'm not worried about anything except Papa's illness,"" replied my companion. ""Compared to Papa, I don't care at all."""
"And I'll never - never - oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than myself.' 'Good words,' I replied. 'But deeds must prove it also; and after he is well, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.' As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch the upper, except from Cathy's present station. In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed scrambling down to recover it.","And I will never, never, oh never, while I have any sense, do a deed or a word that can torment him. I love him more than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; for I would rather be unhappy than see him unhappy: that proves I love him more than myself. ""Fine words,"" I answered. ""But the deeds must prove it too; and if he is well, remember that one does not forget one's resolutions in difficult times."" As we talked, we approached a gate that opened on the street side; and my young wife, again lit by the sun, climbed and sat on the top of the wall to gather rose hips that bloomed scarlet on the upper branches of the wild roses that shaded the street: the lower fruits were gone, but only birds could touch the upper ones, except from Cathy's present vantage point. As she reached out to pick it, her hat fell from her head; and as the door was locked, she offered to go down and get it."
"I bid her be cautious lest she got a fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending. I, like a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her laughing and exclaiming - 'Ellen! you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run round to the porter's lodge.","I told her to be careful, or she'd fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the way back wasn't easy: the stones were smooth and neatly arranged, and the remaining rose bushes and blackberries offered no purchase on the climb. Like an idiot, I didn't remember until I heard her laugh and exclaim, ""Ellen! You have to get the key, or I'll have to run to the gatehouse."""
"I can't scale the ramparts on this side!' 'Stay where you are,' I answered; 'I have my bundle of keys in my pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go.' Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance stopped also. 'Who is that?' I whispered. 'Ellen, I wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion, anxiously. 'Ho, Miss Linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), 'I'm glad to meet you.","""I can't climb the city wall like this!"" ""Stay where you are,"" I replied. ""I have my ring of keys in my pocket. Perhaps I can open it; if not, I'm leaving."" Catherine danced merrily in front of the door while I tried all the large keys one after the other. I had pressed the last one, but none worked. I repeated my wish that it would stay there and was about to run home as fast as possible when an approaching noise startled me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dancing also stopped. ""Who is it?"" I murmured. ""Ellen, I wish you could open the door,"" my companion murmured anxiously. ""Ho, Miss Linton!"" called a deep voice (that of the horseman), ""pleased to meet you."""
"Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and obtain.' 'I sha'n't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,' answered Catherine. 'Papa says you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the same.' 'That is nothing to the purpose,' said Heathcliff. (He it was.) 'I don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out.","Don't hurry, for I must demand and receive an explanation. ""I won't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,"" replied Catherine. ""Father says you are a bad man, and you hate him and me; and Ellen says the same."" ""That matters not,"" said Heathcliff. (He did.) ""I don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is to him that I draw your attention. Yes, you have cause for shame. Weren't you in the habit of writing to Linton two or three months ago? Love out of lust, was it? You both deserved a whipping for that! Especially you, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out."""
"I've got your letters, and if you give me any pertness I'll send them to your father. I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you? Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in earnest: in love, really.","I have your letters, and if you're a bit impertinent, I'll send them to your father. I suppose you've had enough of the fun and stopped, haven't you? Well, you left Linton in a quagmire of despair. He was sincere: genuinely in love."
"As true as I live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily; and he'll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!' 'How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?' I called from the inside. 'Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: you won't believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.' 'I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected villain. 'Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your double-dealing,' he added aloud. 'How could YOU lie so glaringly as to affirm I hated the ""poor child""? and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not spoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father himself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the same error.","As long as I live, he dies for you; your unbelief breaks his heart: not figuratively, but literally. Although Hareton has behaved like a fool towards him for six weeks, and I have taken stricter measures to discourage him from his folly, he is getting worse every day; and before summer comes, he will be buried if you do not bring him to his senses! ""How can you lie so openly to the poor child?"" I cried inwardly. ""Go on! How can you deliberately tell such vile lies? Miss Cathy, I will blow the castle down with a stone: you will not believe such dreadful nonsense. You yourself know that a man cannot possibly die for love of a stranger."" ""I did not know there were indiscreet ears,"" murmured the exposed villain. ""My dear Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I do not like your duplicity,"" he added aloud. ""How could you lie so openly about your hatred of the 'poor child'? And invent horror stories to make her run away from me?"" Catherine Linton (I like that name), my dear, I'm away all week; go and see if you haven't been telling the truth: do so, there's a treasure in it! Imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then consider how much you would value your careless lover if he refused to comfort you, even though your father himself begged him to; and don't, through sheer stupidity, make the same mistake."
"I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none but you can save him!' The lock gave way and I issued out. 'I swear Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me. 'And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you won't let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return till this time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.' 'Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.","I swear by my salvation that he will go to the grave, and no one but you can save him!' The lock gave way, and I went out. 'I swear, Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking me straight in the eye. 'And grief and disappointment will hasten his death. Nelly, if you don't let her go, you may go through it yourself. But I won't be back until next week, and I think your master himself would not much object to her visiting her cousin.' 'Come in,' I said, taking Cathy by the arm and forcing her inside; for she stood scrutinizing the features of my interlocutor with an anxious look too stern to express her deep disappointment."
"He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed - 'Miss Catherine, I'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I'll own that he's with a harsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best medicine.","He urged his horse closer and leaned forward. He said, ""Miss Catherine, I must confess that I have little patience with Linton, and even less with Hareton and Joseph. I must confess that he is a hard-hearted man. He longs for kindness as much as love, and a kind word from you would be his best medicine."""
"Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be persuaded that you don't hate him, since you neither write nor call.' I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now in double darkness.","Ignore Mrs. Dean's cruel warnings, but be generous and go to him. He dreams of you day and night and cannot be convinced that you do not hate him, since you neither write nor call him. I closed the door and rolled in a stone to secure the loose lock. And as I opened my umbrella, I lowered my armor: the rain began to rattle through the creaking branches of the trees, warning us to avoid delay. Our haste prevented us from discussing the meeting with Heathcliff on the way back; but I instinctively sensed that Catherine's heart was now shrouded in double darkness."
"Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true. The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.","Her face was so sad it looked as if it wasn't hers: she obviously took what she had heard for granted. The professor had already gone to bed when we arrived. Cathy sneaked into his room to ask how he was; he had fallen asleep."
"She returned, and asked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was weary. I got a book, and pretended to read.","She came back and asked me to go to the library with her. We drank tea together; then she lay down on the carpet and told me not to talk, she was tired. I picked up a book and pretended to read."
"As soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr. Heathcliff's assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would coincide. Alas! I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had produced: it was just what he intended. 'You may be right, Ellen,' she answered; 'but I shall never feel at ease till I know.","As soon as she noticed that I was completely absorbed in my activity, she began to weep softly again: it seemed to be her favorite pastime at that moment. I let her enjoy it for a moment; then I protested: I mocked and ridiculed Mr. Heathcliff's statements about his son, as if I were sure she would agree with me. Unfortunately, I had no talent for neutralizing the effect of his narrative: it was precisely what he meant. ""You may be right, Ellen,"" she replied, ""but I shall never be at peace until I know."""
"And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don't write, and convince him that I shall not change.' What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We parted that night - hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony. I couldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was founded on fact. THE rainy night had ushered in a misty morning - half frost, half drizzle - and temporary brooks crossed our path - gurgling from the uplands.","And I must tell Linton that it is not my fault if I do not write, and convince him that I will not change. What good is anger and protests against his foolish credulity? We parted that evening in disagreement; but the next day I found myself on the road to Wuthering Heights, beside the pony of my wayward young mistress. I could not bear the sight of her: her pale, dejected face, her heavy eyes; and I gave in, in the faint hope that Linton himself would prove by his reception how little truth there was to the story. The rainy night had given way to a misty morning—half frost, half fog—and now and then streams crossed our path, trickling down from the uplands."
"My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own affirmation. Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.","My feet were wet; I was sullen and dejected—just the right frame of mind to make the best of these unpleasant circumstances. We went into the farmhouse kitchen to see if Mr. Heathcliff was really gone; for I only half believed him. Joseph seemed to be sitting alone in a kind of Elysium by a roaring fire; a quart of beer stood beside him on the table, strewn with large pieces of toasted oatcakes; and he had his short black pipe in his mouth."
"Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown deaf, and repeated it louder. 'Na - ay!' he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. 'Na - ay! yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.' 'Joseph!' cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner room. 'How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now. Joseph! come this moment.' Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no ear for this appeal.","Catherine ran to the fireplace to warm herself. I asked if the Lord was there. My question went unanswered for so long that I thought the old man was going deaf, so I repeated it louder. ""No... ah!"" he cried, or rather, he cried through his nose. ""No... ah! You must go back where you came from."" ""Joseph!"" a rough voice called at the same time as me from the back of the room. ""How many times must I call you? There are only a few clouds of red ash left. Joseph! Come!"" His energetic expression and his determined gaze into the fireplace showed that he had not heard this plea."
"The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton's tones, and entered. 'Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!' said the boy, mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant. He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him. 'Is that you, Miss Linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the great chair, in which he reclined. 'No don't kiss me: it takes my breath.","The housekeeper and Hareton were nowhere to be seen; one was out, the other probably at work. We recognized Linton's tone and went inside. ""Oh, I hope you're starving in a garret!"" said the boy, mistaking us for the careless servant. He stopped abruptly when he realized his mistake: his cousin was rushing toward him. ""Is that you, Miss Linton?"" he asked, raising his head from the arm of the large armchair in which he was leaning. ""No, don't kiss me; it would take my breath away."""
"Dear me! Papa said you would call,' continued he, after recovering a little from Catherine's embrace; while she stood by looking very contrite. 'Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open; and those - those DETESTABLE creatures won't bring coals to the fire. It's so cold!' I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper. 'Well, Linton,' murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed, 'are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?' 'Why didn't you come before?' he asked. 'You should have come, instead of writing.","""My goodness! Papa said you were coming,"" he continued, recovering a little from Catherine's embrace as she stood contritely. ""Would you please close the door? You left it open; and these—these horrible creatures don't put coals on the fire. It's so cold!"" I poked the embers and fetched a bowl for myself. The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a bad cough and seemed feverish and ill, so I didn't reprimand him. ""Well, Linton,"" Catherine murmured, her frown relaxing, ""are you glad to see me? Can I help you?"" ""Why didn't you come sooner?"" he asked. ""You should have come instead of writing."""
"It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I'd far rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else.","Writing these long letters has exhausted me terribly. I would have much preferred to talk to you. Now I can neither talk nor bear anything else."
"I wonder where Zillah is! Will you' (looking at me) 'step into the kitchen and see?' I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest, I replied 'Nobody is out there but Joseph.' 'I want to drink,' he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. 'Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable! And I'm obliged to come down here - they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.' 'Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?' I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances. 'Attentive? He makes them a little more attentive at least,' he cried. 'The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.' Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind. 'And are you glad to see me?' asked she, reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile. 'Yes, I am. It's something new to hear a voice like yours!' he replied. 'But I have been vexed, because you wouldn't come.","I wonder where Zillah is! Could you (with an eye to me) go into the kitchen and see? I had received no thanks for my other services; and not wishing to rush off at his request, I answered, ""There's nobody here but Joseph."" ""I want a drink!"" he cried irritably, turning away. ""Zillah has been going to Gimmerton's since Papa left: it's miserable! And I must come here; they've decided never to listen to me upstairs again."" ""Is your father considerate to you, Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked, observing that Catherine's friendly advances were reserved. ""Considerate? He makes her a little more considerate, at any rate,"" he cried. ""Those scoundrels! You know, Miss Linton, that dirty Hareton laughs at me! I hate him!"" ""Indeed, I hate them all: they're dreadful creatures."" Cathy went in search of water. She placed a carafe on the sideboard, filled a glass, and brought it over. He asked her to pour a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table. After drinking a little, she seemed calmer and said she was very pleasant. ""And you're glad to see me?"" she asked, repeating her previous question. She was pleased when a faint smile appeared on his face. ""Yes, quite. It's new to hear a voice like yours!"" he replied. ""But I was annoyed that you didn't want to come."""
"And papa swore it was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you don't despise me, do you, Miss - ?' 'I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,' interrupted my young lady. 'Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody living. I don't love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come when he returns: will he stay away many days?' 'Not many,' answered Linton; 'but he goes on to the moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence.","And papa swore it was all my fault: he called me a poor, poor good-for-nothing, and said you despised me, and that in my place he would be a better master of the manor than your father. But you do not despise me, Miss—? —I wish you would say Catherine or Cathy, interrupted my young lady. Despise you? No! Except papa and Ellen, I like you better than anyone else. However, I do not like Mr. Heathcliff, and I dare not come if he comes. Will he be away many days? —Not much, replied Linton; but he often goes to the moor since the hunt began, and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence."
"Do say you will. I think I should not be peevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help me, wouldn't you?' 'Yes"" said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair: 'if I could only get papa's consent, I'd spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I wish you were my brother.' 'And then you would like me as well as your father?' observed he, more cheerfully. 'But papa says you would love me better than him and all the world, if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were that.' 'No, I should never love anybody better than papa,' she returned gravely. 'And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.' Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt.","Say that. I don't think I should be so angry with you: you wouldn't provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help me, wouldn't you? ""Yes,"" said Catherine, stroking his long, soft hair, ""if Papa would allow me, I'd spend half my time with you. Nice Linton! I wish you were my brother."" ""And then you'd love me as much as your father?"" he remarked more cheerfully. ""But Papa says you'd love me more than him and everything in the world if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were."" ""No, I'd never love anyone more than Papa,"" she answered seriously. ""And sometimes people hate their wives, but not their brothers and sisters: and if you were the latter, you'd live with us, and Papa would love you as much as me."" Linton denied that one could ever hate one's wives. Cathy, however, confirmed this and, in her wisdom, pointed out her own father's dislike of her aunt."
"I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn't succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted her relation was false. 'Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,' she answered pertly. 'MY papa scorns yours!' cried Linton. 'He calls him a sneaking fool.' 'Yours is a wicked man,' retorted Catherine; 'and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says.","I tried to silence her. I only succeeded after she had told everything. Master Heathcliff, extremely annoyed, claimed her story was false. ""Papa told me, and Papa doesn't lie,"" she retorted rudely. ""My papa despises yours!"" cried Linton. ""He calls him cunning and stupid."" ""Your papa is a bad man,"" retorted Catherine, ""and you have the nerve to repeat everything he says."""
"He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she did.' 'She didn't leave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contradict me.' 'She did,' cried my young lady. 'Well, I'll tell you something!' said Linton. 'Your mother hated your father: now then.' 'Oh!' exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue. 'And she loved mine,' added he. 'You little liar! I hate you now!' she panted, and her face grew red with passion. 'She did! she did!' sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair, and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant, who stood behind. 'Hush, Master Heathcliff!' I said; 'that's your father's tale, too, I suppose.' 'It isn't: you hold your tongue!' he answered. 'She did, she did, Catherine! she did, she did!' Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even me.","He must have been wicked to let Aunt Isabella go so easily. ""She didn't leave him,"" said the boy; ""you won't argue with me."" ""Yes, she did,"" cried my young wife. ""Well, I'll tell you!"" said Linton. ""Your mother hated your father: well!"" ""Oh!"" cried Catherine, too angry to speak further. ""And she loved mine,"" he added. ""Little liar! Now I hate you!"" she gasped, her face red with rage. ""It was she! It was she!"" crooned Linton, sinking back in his chair and leaning his head back to enjoy the excitement of the other quarrelsome man behind him. ""Hush, Mr. Heathcliff!"" I said; ""I suppose that's your father's story too."" ""It isn't so: be quiet!"" he answered. It was she, it was she, Catherine! It was she, it was she! Cathy, beside herself, violently kicked the chair over, hurling it against an armrest. He immediately suffered a choking coughing fit that put an end to his triumph. It lasted so long that even I was frightened."
"As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down silently.","His cousin wept heartily, stunned by the chaos she had caused, but she said nothing. I held him in my arms until the attack was over. Then he pushed me away and bowed his head in silence."
"Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire. 'How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired, after waiting ten minutes. 'I wish SHE felt as I do,' he replied: 'spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better to-day: and there - ' his voice died in a whimper. 'I didn't strike you!' muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion. He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice. 'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,' she said at length, racked beyond endurance. 'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, Linton? Don't let me go home thinking I've done you harm.","Catherine, too, suppressed her groans, sat down opposite her, and gazed gravely into the fire. ""How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?"" I asked after ten minutes. ""I wish she felt as I do,"" he replied. ""What a vile, cruel man! Hareton never touched me: he never beat me all his life. And today I felt better: and then—"" His voice broke into a groan. ""I didn't beat you!"" murmured Cathy, biting her lip to suppress another outburst of emotion. He sighed and groaned like one in deep pain and continued to do so for a quarter of an hour; evidently to get even with his cousin, for every suppressed sob she unleashed doubled her pain and pathos. ""I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,"" she finally said in unbearable agony. ""But that little push can't hurt me, and I didn't think you could be hurt either: you're not a man, are you, Linton? Don't make me go home thinking I hurt you."""
"Answer! speak to me.' 'I can't speak to you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt me so that I shall lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you'd know what it was; but YOU'LL be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!' And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself. 'Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,' I said, 'it won't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come.","Answer! Speak to me. —I cannot speak to you, he murmured. You have hurt me so much that I lie awake all night choking on this cough. If you had it, you would know what it is; but you will sleep soundly, while I live in agony with no one near me. I wonder how you would like to spend these dreadful nights! And he began to groan aloud, out of pure pity. —Since you are accustomed to spending dreadful nights, I said, it will not be Mademoiselle who disturbs your sleep; you would be as if she had never come."
"However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter when we leave you.' 'Must I go?' asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. 'Do you want me to go, Linton?' 'You can't alter what you've done,' he replied pettishly, shrinking from her, 'unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.' 'Well, then, I must go?' she repeated. 'Let me alone, at least,' said he; 'I can't bear your talking.' She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can.","But she won't bother you anymore; and perhaps you'll be calmer if we leave you alone. ""Shall I go?"" asked Catherine gloomily, leaning towards him. ""Shall I go, Linton?"" ""You can't help it,"" he answered sullenly, drawing back, ""unless you make things worse by irritating me until I get a fever."" ""Then I must go?"" she repeated. ""Leave me alone at least,"" he said; ""I can't bear your talking."" She stood there, resisting my attempts to leave for a weary moment; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she at last went to the door, and I followed her. A shout called us back. Linton had slipped from his chair onto the mantelpiece and was writhing in pain, with the stubbornness of a fractious and self-indulgent child determined to be as serious and disturbing as possible."
"I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her. 'I shall lift him on to the settle,' I said, 'and he may roll about as he pleases: we can't stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.","I accurately assessed his state of mind from his behavior and immediately realized that it would be foolish to please him. My companion did not: she ran back in fear, knelt down, wept, consoled, and begged until he fell silent and gasped—and not out of remorse for having upset her. ""I'll lift him onto the sofa,"" I said, ""and he can roll around as he pleases; we can't stand here and watch him. I hope you are convinced, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person who can help him; and that his condition is not due to his attachment to you."""
"Now, then, there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense, he'll be glad to lie still.' She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably. 'I can't do with that,' he said; 'it's not high enough.' Catherine brought another to lay above it. 'That's too high,' murmured the provoking thing. 'How must I arrange it, then?' she asked despairingly. He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and converted her shoulder into a support. 'No, that won't do,' I said. 'You'll be content with the cushion, Master Heathcliff.","Well, there he is! Come on, once he knows no one is bothering him with his nonsense, he'll be glad to lie still. She placed a pillow under his head and offered him water; he refused, throwing himself uncomfortably onto the pillow as if it were a rock or a block of wood. She tried to position him more comfortably. ""I can't do that,"" he said, ""it's not high enough."" Catherine brought another pillow to rest on. ""It's too high,"" murmured the provocative creature. ""How am I supposed to do it then?"" she asked desperately. He pressed himself against her, while she knelt half-beside the bench, using her shoulder for support. ""No, that won't do,"" I said. ""You'll have to be content with the pillow, Master Heathcliff."""
"Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot remain five minutes longer.' 'Yes, yes, we can!' replied Cathy. 'He's good and patient now. He's beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I musn't come, if I have hurt you.' 'You must come, to cure me,' he answered. 'You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when you entered as I am at present - was I?' 'But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion. - I didn't do it all,' said his cousin. 'However, we'll be friends now.","Miss has already wasted too much time with you; we can't stay more than five minutes. ""Yes, yes, we can!"" answered Cathy. ""He is kind and patient now. He begins to think that I shall be much worse off tonight than he is if I think he is in a worse state when I visit: and then I dare not come. Tell the truth, Linton; for I must not come if I have hurt you."" ""You must come and cure me,"" he answered. ""You must come, for you have hurt me; you know you have hurt me very much! I wasn't as sick when you came as I am now, was I?"" ""But you made yourself sick by crying and getting angry. I had nothing to do with it,"" said his cousin. ""But we shall be friends now."""
"And you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?' 'I told you I did,' he replied impatiently. 'Sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee. That's as mamma used to do, whole afternoons together. Sit quite still and don't talk: but you may sing a song, if you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad - one of those you promised to teach me; or a story.","And you desire me? You really want to see me? ""I told you,"" he replied impatiently. ""Sit on the sofa and let me lean on your lap. Mother always did that in the afternoons. Stay very still and don't speak. But you can sing a song, if you can sing; or you can recite a beautiful, long, interesting ballad—one of those you promised to teach me—or a story."""
"I'd rather have a ballad, though: begin.' Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner. 'And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?' asked young Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly. 'No,' I answered, 'nor next day neither.' She, however, gave a different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear. 'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when we were out of the house. 'You are not dreaming of it, are you?' She smiled. 'Oh, I'll take good care,' I continued: 'I'll have that lock mended, and you can escape by no way else.' 'I can get over the wall,' she said laughing. 'The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.","""But I would prefer a ballad—begin!"" Catherine repeated for as long as she could remember. The task pleased them both immensely. Linton wanted another and another, despite my strongest objections; and so they continued until the clock struck midnight, and we heard Hareton in the courtyard returning to supper. ""And tomorrow, Catherine, will you be there?"" asked young Heathcliff, clutching his gown and rising reluctantly. ""No,"" I answered, ""nor the day after."" She evidently gave a different answer, for her brow lit up as she bent down and whispered in his ear: ""You're not going away tomorrow, remember, miss!"" I began, once we were out of the house. ""You're not dreaming of it, are you?"" She smiled. ""Oh, I'll be very careful,"" I continued. ""I'll have the lock mended, or you won't be able to escape."" ""I'll get through the wall,"" she laughed. “The barn is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my jailer.”"
"And besides, I'm almost seventeen: I'm a woman. And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I not? And he'll soon do as I direct him, with some slight coaxing.","And besides, I'm almost seventeen: I'm a woman. And I'm sure Linton would soon recover if I took care of him. I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, aren't I? And with a little encouragement, he'll soon do as I say."
"He's a pretty little darling when he's good. I'd make such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should, never quarrel, should we after we were used to each other? Don't you like him, Ellen?' 'Like him!' I exclaimed. 'The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens.","He's a treasure when he's good. I'd make him my darling if he were mine. We shouldn't quarrel anymore, now that we've gotten used to each other. Don't you love him, Ellen? ""Good!"" I cried. ""He's the most ill-tempered, sickly creature a man ever became."""
"Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he'll not win twenty. I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his family whenever he drops off.","Fortunately, as Mr. Heathcliff had suspected, he won't gain twenty years. I doubt he'll live to see spring. And it would be a small loss to his family if he were to fall again."
"And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he'd be. I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.' My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings. 'He's younger than I,' she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, 'and he ought to live the longest: he will - he must live as long as I do.","And how fortunate for us that his father adopted him: the more kindly he was treated, the more boring and selfish he would become. I'm glad you won't be getting him as your husband, Mademoiselle Catherine. My companion became serious during this speech. Speaking of his death with such indifference pained her. ""He is younger than I am,"" she replied after much thought, ""and he is the one who will live the longest: He will live, he will live as long as I will."""
"He's as strong now as when he first came into the north; I'm positive of that. It's only a cold that ails him, the same as papa has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?' 'Well, well,' I cried, 'after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for listen, Miss, - and mind, I'll keep my word, - if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.' 'It has been revived,' muttered Cathy, sulkily. 'Must not be continued, then,' I said. 'We'll see,' was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.","He is as strong now as he was when he came north; I am sure of it. He is only troubled by a cold, just like Papa. You say Papa will be well again, and why should he not? 'Now, now,' I cried, 'let us not worry; for listen, Miss—and you know, I keep my word: if you attempt to return to Wuthering Heights, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and if he does not consent, your friendship with your cousin must not be resumed.' 'She is well,' murmured Cathy sullenly. 'Then it must not go on like this,' I said. 'We shall see,' she answered, and ran off, hardly leaving me alone."
"We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since.","We were both home before dinner; my master assumed we had been out for a walk in the park and therefore didn't ask for an explanation for our absence. As soon as I arrived, I hurried to change my soaked shoes and socks; but the long sitting on the heights had taken its toll. The next morning I was in bed, unable to perform my duties for three weeks: a catastrophe I had never experienced before and am glad I haven't experienced again since."
"My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she appeared at my bedside.","My little mistress came like an angel to care for me and ease my loneliness; the delivery was extremely depressing. It's exhausting for a body brimming with energy: few people have as much to complain about as I do. As soon as Catherine left Mr. Linton's room, she appeared at my bedside."
"Her day was divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her own.","Her day was divided between us; not a moment of conversation was lost: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her games; and she was the most beloved nurse there ever was. She must have had a kind heart, since she loved her father so much that she gave me so much. I used to say that her days were divided between us; but the governess went to bed early, and I usually didn't need anything after 6 p.m., so the evening belonged to her."
"Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers, instead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library. AT the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about the house.","Poor girl! I never thought about what she did with herself after tea. And although I often noticed a fresh blush on her cheeks and a rosy glow on her slender fingers when saying goodnight, I didn't imagine the sentence she had borrowed on a cold walk across the moor, but placed it on the blazing fire in the library. After three weeks, I was able to leave my room and move around the house."
"And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused. She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions. 'Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn't you better lie down now? You'll be sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.' 'No, no, dear, I'm not tired,' I returned, continually.","And as I lay awake that night, I asked Catherine to read to me, as I had been slacking off. We were in the library, and the mistress was already in bed. She agreed, though somewhat reluctantly, I think. And, imagining that she didn't like my kind of books, I asked her to choose what she wanted to read. She chose one of her favorites and walked quietly for about an hour. Then she kept asking me questions. ""Ellen, aren't you tired? Lie down for a bit? You're sick from staying up so late, Ellen."" ""No, no, dear, I'm not tired,"" I answered again and again."
"Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching, and 'Ellen, I'm tired.' 'Give over then and talk,' I answered. That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep; judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.","When she saw me motionless, she tried to express her disgust at what I had done in another way. She yawned, stretched, and said, ""Ellen, I'm tired."" ""Forget it and talk,"" I replied. Even worse, she brooded and sighed, looked at the clock until 8:00, and finally returned to her room, completely overcome by sleep, judging by her heavy, sullen expression and the constant rubbing of her eyes."
"The following night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs in the dark. No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below.","The following night, she seemed even more impatient; and on the third day after finding me again, she complained of a headache and left me. I found her behavior strange; and after we had been alone for a long time, I decided to ask her if she was feeling better and ask her to lie down on the sofa instead of staying upstairs in the dark. I found Catherine neither upstairs nor downstairs."
"The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar's door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the window.","The staff confirmed they hadn't seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar's door; everything was quiet. I returned to his apartment, extinguished my candle, and sat by the window."
"The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and reappeared presently, leading Miss's pony; and there she was, just dismounted, and walking by its side.","The moon shone brightly; a thin layer of snow covered the ground, and I thought she might have taken it into her head to stroll into the garden and get some fresh air. I saw a figure steal behind the park fence; but it was not my young mistress: in the light, I recognized one of the grooms. He stood for a long time, looking at the road that led through the park; then he moved away quickly, as if he had noticed something, and reappeared a moment later, Mademoiselle's pony at his side; and there she was, just dismounted, walking beside him."
"The man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited her. She put the door gently too, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.","The man stealthily resumed his work across the grass toward the stable. Cathy came in through the living room window and quietly crept over to where I was waiting for her. She, too, carefully opened the door, took off her snow-white shoes, tied on her hat, and, oblivious to my observation, was just about to take off her cloak when I suddenly stood up and revealed myself."
"The surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed. 'My dear Miss Catherine,' I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where have you been? Speak!' 'To the bottom of the park,' she stammered. 'I didn't tell a tale.' 'And nowhere else?' I demanded. 'No,' was the muttered reply. 'Oh, Catherine!' I cried, sorrowfully. 'You know you have been doing wrong, or you wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That does grieve me. I'd rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a deliberate lie.' CHAPTER XXIV She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my neck. 'Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry,' she said. 'Promise not to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.' We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced 'I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I've never missed going a day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your room.","Surprise paralyzed her for a moment; she uttered an inaudible cry and stood frozen. ""My dear Miss Catherine,"" I began, too overcome by her recent kindness to reprove her, ""where have you gone at this hour? And why are you trying to deceive me with a story? Where have you been? Speak!"" ""To the end of the park,"" she stammered. ""I told no story."" ""And nowhere else?"" I asked. ""No,"" she murmured. ""Oh, Catherine!"" I cried dolefully. ""You know you have done wrong, or you need not have been driven to lie. It grieves me. I would rather be ill for three months than see you invent a deliberate lie."" CHAPTER XXIV She jumped up, burst into tears, and threw herself on my neck. ""Well, Ellen, I am afraid you are angry,"" she said. ""Promise me you won't be angry, and you'll find out the truth: I don't mean to hide it."" We sat down on the windowsill. I assured her I wouldn't scold her, whatever her secret might be, and sure enough, I guessed it. So she began: ""I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I haven't been away a day since you were taken ill; except three times before, and twice since you left your room."
"I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn't scold him either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time.","Every evening, I gave Michael books and pictures so he could get Minny ready and take her back to the stable: you can't scold her, you know. I was at The Heights at 6:30 p.m. and usually stayed there until 8:30 p.m., then I quickly went home. I didn't go there to entertain myself: I often felt miserable the whole time."
"Now and then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-stairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the pony.","Sometimes I was happy: perhaps once a week. At first, I thought it would be a real challenge to persuade you to keep Linton's word: after all, I had promised to come back the next day when we left him; but as you had stayed upstairs the day after, I spared myself the inconvenience. That afternoon, while Michael was locking the park gate, I took the key and told him my cousin wanted me to visit him, as he was ill and couldn't come to the Grange; and Papa objected. Then I negotiated with him about the pony."
"He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that satisfied him better. 'On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs - robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards - we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good- natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn't repeat that, because you would call it silly. 'One time, however, we were near quarrelling.","He loves reading and is planning to get married soon. So he offered to do anything I wanted if I would lend him some books from the library. But I preferred to give him mine, which he liked better. ""On my second visit, Linton seemed in good spirits; and Zillah (their housekeeper) prepared a clean room and a nice fire for us. She told us we could do as we liked, as Joseph was at a prayer meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was out with his dogs—and, as I later learned, raiding our pheasant woods. She brought me mulled wine and gingerbread and seemed extremely good-natured. Linton sat in the armchair and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth, and we laughed and talked so gaily and had so much to talk about; we made plans about where to go and what to do in the summer. I needn't repeat it, because you would think it absurd."" ""But once we almost quarreled."""
"He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee.","He said the best way to spend a hot July day was to lie on a moor from morning till night, right in the heart of the moor, with the bees buzzing dreamily among the flowers, the larks singing high overhead, and the sky blue and the sun bright, without cloud or interruption. This was his most perfect idea of heavenly happiness; mine was to swing in a rustling green tree with a west wind and brilliant white clouds passing swiftly overhead; and not only larks, but thrushes, blackbirds, linnets, and cuckoos singing all around, and the moor visible in the distance, broken by cool, dark valleys; but quite close by, great waves of tall grass swaying in the breeze; and woods and rippling waters, and the whole world awake and joyful. He wanted everyone to rest in an intoxication of peace; I wanted everyone to shine and dance in a glorious exultation."
"I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends. 'After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me.","I said his heaven was half alive; and he said mine was drunk; I said I was falling asleep in his; and he said he couldn't breathe in mine, and was getting out of breath. At last we both decided to try it, as soon as time permitted; and then we kissed and became friends. After we had sat quietly for an hour, I looked around the large room with the smooth, uncarpeted floor, and thought it would be nice to play there with the table gone; and I asked Linton to call Zillah for help, and we would play blind man's buff; she would try to catch us: you did, Ellen. He didn't like it: he didn't like it, he said; but he agreed to play with me."
"We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn't like it. I beat him constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his chair.","We found two in a cupboard, amidst a pile of old toys: tops, hoops, throwing boxes, and springs. One had a C written on it, the other an H. I wanted the C because it stood for Catherine, and the H could have been Heathcliff, his name; but the sound came from H, and Linton didn't like that. I hit him again and again; he got angry again, coughed, and went back to his seat."
"That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs - YOUR songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and CHAPTER XXIV my sweet, darling cousin, till morning. 'On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights me more, my pretty Linton will.","That evening, however, he quickly recovered his good humor: two or three beautiful songs—YOUR songs, Ellen—enchanted him. When I had to go, he asked me to come back the next evening, and I promised. Light as a feather, Minny and I went home, and I dreamed of Wuthering Heights and my beloved niece until morning. The next morning I was sad; partly because you were ill, and partly because I wished my father had known about and approved of my excursions. But after tea, the moonlight was beautiful; and as I walked on, the darkness lifted. I shall have a pleasant evening yet, I told myself; and what will please me more will be my beautiful Linton."
"I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny's neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick him.","I trotted to her farm and was about to turn back when a man named Earnshaw approached me, grabbed my bridle, and led me through the front gate. He patted Minny on the neck and told her she was a sweet animal and seemed to want me to talk to her. I just told him to leave my horse alone, or he would kick it."
"He answered in his vulgar accent, ""It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it did;"" and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ""Miss Catherine! I can read yon, now."" '""Wonderful,"" I exclaimed. ""Pray let us hear you - you ARE grown clever!"" 'He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name - ""Hareton Earnshaw."" '""And the figures?"" I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a dead halt. '""I cannot tell them yet,"" he answered. '""Oh, you dunce!"" I said, laughing heartily at his failure. 'The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.","He replied in his vulgar accent, ""It wouldn't hurt Mitch if it were so,"" and smiled, examining the paws. I was almost tempted to try it, but he went to the door, lifted the latch, looked at the inscription above it, and said with a mixture of embarrassment and glee, ""Miss Catherine! I'm reading you now."" ""Wonderful!"" I exclaimed. ""Tell us, you've gotten clever!"" He spelled the name, stressing the syllables: ""Hareton Earnshaw."" ""And the numbers?"" I called encouragingly, when he suddenly stopped. ""I can't say them yet,"" he replied. ""Oh, you silly!"" I said, laughing heartily at his failure. The idiot stared at me, smiling and frowning, as if considering whether to join in the laughter: was this pleasant familiarity or, what it really was, contempt? I dispelled his doubts by suddenly becoming serious and asking him to leave, for I had come to see Linton, not him."
"He reddened - I saw that by the moonlight - dropped his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same.' 'Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!' - I interrupted. 'I shall not scold, but I don't like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way.","He blushed—I saw him in the moonlight—dropped his hand on the latch, and slunk away, a symbol of wounded vanity. He considered himself as competent as Linton, presumably because he could spell his own name; and he was surprisingly dismayed that I didn't think the same. ""Stop it, Miss Catherine, my dear!"" I interrupted. ""I don't mean to scold you, but I don't appreciate your behavior. If you had considered that Hareton was as much your cousin as Master Heathcliff, you would have understood how unseemly this behavior was."""
"At least, it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had you been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I'm hurt that he should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.' 'Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will you?' she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness. 'But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.","It was certainly a laudable ambition of his to strive for as much success as Linton; and he probably didn't learn it just to show off: you had no doubt already reproached him for his ignorance; and he wanted to correct it and please you. To laugh at his imperfect efforts was a sign of very bad breeding. Had you been brought up under his circumstances, would you have been less rude? He was as lively and clever a child as you are; and it pains me that he is now despised because that wicked Heathcliff treated him so unfairly. ""Well, Ellen, you won't cry, will you?"" she cried, surprised by my earnestness. ""But wait, and then you'll know whether he has twisted his ABCs to please me; and whether it has been worth your while to be civil to the beast."""
"I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me. '""I'm ill to-night, Catherine, love,"" he said; ""and you must have all the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn't break your word, and I'll make you promise again, before you go."" 'I knew now that I mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.","I entered; Linton was lying on the sofa and half rose to receive me. ""I am ill this evening, Catherine, my dear,"" he said, ""and you must talk so that I can listen. Come and sit by me. I felt sure you would not break your word, and I will exact your promise once more before you go."" I knew now that I must not anger him, for he was ill; so I spoke gently, without asking questions, and avoided irritating him."
"I had brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat. '""Get to thy own room!"" he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and CHAPTER XXIV furious. ""Take her there if she comes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this. Begone wi' ye both!"" 'He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down.","I had brought him some of my favorite books. He asked me to read him a passage, and I was about to oblige when Earnshaw, lost in thought, flung open the door. He strode toward us, grabbed Linton by the arm, and threw him off his chair. ""Go to your room!"" he said, his voice barely audible with anger; his face was swollen and furious. ""Take her there when she comes to visit you. You won't lock me out. Get out of here, both of you!"" He cursed us and didn't give Linton time to reply. He almost hurled him into the kitchen. He clenched his fist as I followed, evidently preparing to hit me."
"I was afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering. '""I wer sure he'd sarve ye out! He's a grand lad! He's getten t' raight sperrit in him! HE knaws - ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t' maister yonder - Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech, ech!"" '""Where must we go?"" I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch's mockery. 'Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no! he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic, powerless fury.","I was startled for a moment and dropped a book; he hurled it behind me, preventing us from entering. I heard an evil, crackling laugh by the fire, and when I turned around, I saw that loathsome Joseph standing there, rubbing his bony hands, trembling. ""I knew he'd finish you off! He's a good fellow! He's got a good mind! He knows—indeed, he knows as well as I do who's boss around here—Eh, eh, eh! He's got you right! Eh, eh, eh!"" ""Where are we going?"" I asked my cousin, ignoring the old man's sneering remarks. ""Linton was pale and trembling. He wasn't handsome, Ellen: oh no! He looked dreadful; his narrow face and large eyes expressed a panicked, impotent rage."""
"He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it: it was fastened inside. '""If you don't let me in, I'll kill you! - If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!"" he rather shrieked than said. ""Devil! devil! - I'll kill you - I'll kill you!"" Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again. '""Thear, that's t' father!"" he cried. ""That's father! We've allas summut o' either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad - dunnut be 'feard - he cannot get at thee!"" 'I took hold of Linton's hands, and tried to pull him away; but he shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the ground.","He grabbed the doorknob and shook it: it was locked from the inside. ""If you don't let me in, I'll kill you! If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!"" he screamed, instead of saying it. ""Devil! Devil! I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"" Joseph laughed hoarsely. ""Good heavens, it's Father!"" he cried. ""It's Father! We all have both inside us. Don't be afraid, Hareton, my boy, don't be afraid, he can't touch you!"" I grabbed Linton's hands and tried to pull him away, but he screamed so loudly that I didn't dare go any further. Finally, his screams were drowned out by a violent coughing fit; blood spurted from his mouth and he fell to the floor."
"I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired what there was to do? I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs.","Terrified, I ran into the yard and called loudly for Zillah. She soon heard me: she was milking cows in a pen behind the barn and had rushed down from her work to ask what was wrong. I could hardly explain; I dragged her inside and looked around for Linton. Earnshaw had gone out to see what he had done and was just mounting the poor animal."
"Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn't go in: I must go home. I exclaimed that he had killed Linton, and I WOULD enter. Joseph locked the door, and declared I should do ""no sich stuff,"" and asked me whether I were ""bahn to be as mad as him."" I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.","Zillah and I followed him, but he stopped me at the top of the stairs and told me not to go in: I had to go back. I screamed that he had murdered Linton and I wanted to go in at all costs. Joseph locked the door and told me not to do anything stupid. He asked me if I was as crazy as he was. I stood there crying until the housekeeper came back."
"She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn't do with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house. 'Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me ""wisht,"" and denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold of me. '""Miss Catherine, I'm ill grieved,"" he began, ""but it's rayther too bad - "" 'I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my senses. 'I didn't bid you good-night that evening, and I didn't go to Wuthering Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.","She assured him he would soon feel better, but he couldn't stand the shouting and noise. So she picked me up and practically carried me to the house. ""Ellen, I could have almost pulled my hair out!"" I sobbed and cried so much I was almost blind. And the villain you sympathize with stood before me: he dared to call me ""Wish"" now and then and denied it was his fault. And finally, terrified by my claims that I would tell Papa and he would be imprisoned and hanged, he began to sob himself and ran out to hide his cowardly excitement. But I wasn't rid of him yet: when they had finally pushed me away and I was only a few hundred yards from the property, he suddenly leaped out of the shadows of the road, stopped Minny, and grabbed me. ""Miss Catherine, I am deeply grieved,"" he began, ""but this is far too much—"" ""I gave him a lash of the whip because I thought he was going to kill me. He let me go, uttered one of his horrible curses, and I galloped home half-mad. I neither said good night to you that evening, nor did I go to Wuthering Heights the next day. I longed to go there, but I was strangely excited, and sometimes I dreaded hearing of Linton's death, and sometimes I shuddered at the thought of meeting Hareton."""
"On the third day I took courage: at least, I CHAPTER XXIV couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole off once more. I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton's room, unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach.","On the third day, I plucked up the courage: I couldn't stand the waiting any longer, so I sneaked out again. I left at five o'clock, thinking I could sneak into the house and get to Linton's room. But the dogs noticed me."
"Zillah received me, and saying ""the lad was mending nicely,"" showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked from the room.","Zillah greeted me and said, ""The boy has woken up."" Afterward, I entered a clean, small, carpeted apartment. To my great joy, I saw Linton lying on a small sofa, reading one of my books. But he didn't speak to me for an hour, or even look at me, Ellen: he was in such a bad mood. And what completely surprised me when he opened his mouth was that I had caused the whole commotion with my lie, and it wasn't Hareton's fault! Unable to respond except passionately, I stood up and left the room."
"He sent after me a faint ""Catherine!"" He did not reckon on being answered so: but I wouldn't turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed. It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong to refrain.","He sent me a vague ""Catherine!"" He hadn't expected such a reply, but I didn't want to go back; and the next day I stayed home for the second time, almost determined never to visit him again. But it was so painful to go to bed and get up without ever hearing from him that my resolve vanished before it had fully formed. Starting the trip had seemed like a mistake; now it also seemed a mistake to cut it short."
"Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said ""Yes,"" and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying to conceal my presence. '""Young master is in the house,"" said Zillah, as she saw me making for the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly.","Michael came and asked if he could saddle Minny. I said ""yes,"" considering myself a chore while she carried me over the hills. I had to pass the front windows to get into the yard; hiding was no use. ""The young master is in the house,"" said Zillah, seeing me approaching the parlor. I went in; Earnshaw was there too, but immediately left the room."
"Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true '""As you don't like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject."" '""Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,"" he answered. ""You are so much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody! I am worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if you choose, you may say good-bye: you'll get rid of an annoyance.","Linton was half asleep in his large armchair. I stepped to the fire and began in a serious, almost convincing tone: ""Since you dislike me, Linton, and because you think I mean to harm you on purpose, and you behave so every time, this is our last meeting. Let us say goodbye and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you do not wish to see me again and that he should not invent any more lies about it."" ""Sit down and take off your hat, Catherine,"" he replied. ""You are so much happier than I; you ought to be happier. Papa talks so often about my faults and shows me such contempt that I doubt myself. I wonder if I am not as useless as he often tells me; and then I am so angry and bitter that I hate everyone! I am useless, ill-tempered, and bad-tempered, almost always; and if you like, you can say goodbye to me: then you will be rid of a source of annoyance."""
"Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn't, and cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent it till I die!"" 'I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not entirely for sorrow; yet I WAS sorry Linton had that distorted nature.","Only, Catherine, be just to me: believe that if I could be as sweet, kind, and good as you, I would be; as happy, and happier still, as if I were as happy and healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me love you more deeply than if I deserved your love. And though I could not and cannot refrain from revealing my nature to you, I regret it, and will regret it, and will regret it until I die! ""I felt that he spoke the truth; and I felt that I must forgive him; and even if we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we both wept the whole time I stayed: not only from grief, but I was sorry that Linton had such a stubborn disposition."""
"He'll never let his friends be at ease, and he'll never be at ease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night; because his father returned the day after. 'About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I've learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.","He never leaves his friends alone, and he is never alone himself! Since that evening, I have always gone to his parlor, for his father came again the next day.

Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me; I have hardly seen him. Last Sunday, even earlier than usual, I heard him cruelly reproving poor Linton for his conduct the day before."""
"I can't tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so. He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of the matter.","I can't say how he knew, unless he was listening. Linton had certainly behaved provocatively; however, that was entirely my business, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by going in and telling him. He burst out laughing and left. He said he was glad I shared his point of view."
"Since then, I've told Linton he must whisper his bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can't be prevented from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas, if you'll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of none.","Since then, I've instructed Linton to whisper his bitter words. ""Ellen, you heard everything. No one can stop me from going to Wuthering Heights unless I cause trouble for two people. If you don't tell Papa, I won't have to bother anyone."""
"You'll not tell, will you? It will be very heartless, if you do.' 'I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,' I replied. 'It requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest, and go think it over.' I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end.","You won't tell, will you? That would be cruel of you. ""I'll decide tomorrow, Miss Catherine,"" I replied. ""It requires a little thought; so I'll leave you to think it over alone."" I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; I went directly from his room to hers and told him the whole story, except for his conversations with his cousin and the mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was shocked and upset, more than he cared to admit. The next morning, Catherine learned that I had betrayed her trust, and she also learned that her secret visits would be at an end."
"In vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew's disposition and state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation. 'THESE things happened last winter, sir,' said Mrs. Dean; 'hardly more than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months' end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them! Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger? You're too young to rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could see Catherine Linton and not love her.","In vain she wept and writhed against the prohibition, and implored her father to pity Linton. The only consolation she could muster was to promise to write to him, allowing him to come to the Grange whenever he chose, but to explain that he must not see Catherine again at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps he would have seen fit to refuse her even this feeble consolation if he had known of his nephew's state of health. ""These things happened last winter, sir,"" said Mrs. Dean; ""scarcely more than a year ago. Last winter I did not think that in twelve years I should be able to entertain a stranger to the family with this story! But who knows how long you will remain a stranger? You are too young to live alone; and I believe no one can see Catherine Linton without loving her."""
"You smile; but why do you look so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why - ?' 'Stop, my good friend!' I cried. 'It may be very possible that I should love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here. I'm of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on.","You laugh; but why do you look so lively and interested when I speak of her? And why did you ask me to hang her portrait over your fireplace? And why—"" ""Stop, my dear friend!"" I cried. ""It is quite possible that I love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to risk my peace by yielding to temptation. And besides, my home is not here. I belong to the busy world and must return to its arms. Go."""
"Was Catherine obedient to her father's commands?' 'She was,' continued the housekeeper. 'Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, ""I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect of improvement, as he grows a man?"" '""He's very delicate, sir,"" I replied; ""and scarcely likely to reach manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.","Did Catherine follow her father's instructions? ""Yes,"" the housekeeper continued. ""Her affection for him was still the deepest feeling in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke with the deep tenderness of one who is about to leave his treasure amidst dangers and enemies, where his words are the only support he can leave her."" A few days later, he said to me, ""I wish my nephew would write to me, Ellen, or call. Tell me honestly what you think of him: has he changed for the better, or is there any prospect of improvement as he grows older?"" ""He is very frail, sir,"" I replied; ""and it is unlikely that he will reach manhood. But one thing I can say: he is not like his father; and should Miss Catherine have the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her grasp unless she showed unusual and foolish indulgence."""
"However, master, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his being of age.""' Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the sparely-scattered gravestones. 'I've prayed often,' he half soliloquised, 'for the approach of what is coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I've been very happy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side.","""But, sir, you'll have plenty of time to get to know him and see if he's right for her: he's over four years old."" Edgar sighed and went to the window to look at Gimmerton Church. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone weakly, and we could just make out the two firs in the garden and the scattered gravestones. ""I have often prayed,"" he said, half-concentrated, ""for what is to come; and now I begin to shrink from it and dread it. I thought the memory of the hour when I came to this valley as a bridegroom would be less sweet than the expectation of soon, in a few months, or perhaps a few weeks, being carried there and laid in that lonely hollow! Ellen, I have been very happy with my little Cathy: winter nights and summer days, she has been a living hope by my side."""
"But I've been as happy musing by myself among those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June evenings, on the green mound of her mother's grave, and wishing - yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I do for Cathy? How must I quit her? I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss. I'd not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be unworthy - only a feeble tool to his father - I cannot abandon her to him! And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.","But I was just as happy meditating alone among these stones beneath this old church: lying the long June evenings on the green mound of her mother's grave, dreaming of the day when I may rest there. What can I do for Cathy? How can I leave her? It would mean little to me that Linton is Heathcliff's son; nor that he has taken her from me, if he could console her for my loss. It would mean little to me that Heathcliff has achieved his purpose and triumphantly taken my last benediction! But if Linton is unworthy—a weak tool for his father—then I cannot leave her to him! And though it is hard to break her good humor, I must mourn her persistently while I live, and leave her alone when I die."
"Darling! I'd rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.' 'Resign her to God as it is, sir,' I answered, 'and if we should lose you - which may He forbid - under His providence, I'll stand her friend and counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don't fear that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded.' Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her inexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.","My darling! I would rather entrust her to God and bury her myself. ""Commit her to God as she is, sir,"" I replied, ""and if we lose you—which he forbids us in his providence—I will stand by his friend and advisor to the end. Mademoiselle Catherine is a good girl: I have no fear that she will deliberately commit evil deeds; and whoever does their duty is always rewarded in the end. Spring was approaching; but my master could not really find the strength for it, although he resumed his walks in the park with his daughter. In her inexperienced opinion, this was already a sign of recovery; and besides, his cheeks were often red and his eyes bright; she was sure he would recover."
"On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was raining, and I observed - 'You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?' He answered, - 'No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.' He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father would have permitted him to come. CHAPTER XXV As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided. That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.","On his seventeenth birthday, he did not go to the churchyard: it was raining, and I said to him, ""You are not going out to-night, are you, sir?"" He replied, ""No, I will put it off until later."" He wrote again to Linton, expressing his sincere desire to see him; and had the invalid been fit to present himself, his father would certainly have given him permission. CHAPTER XXV When, however, he received the instructions, he replied that Mr. Heathcliff had objected to his being appointed to the Grange; but the friendly remembrance of his uncle cheered him, and he hoped to meet him occasionally in his wanderings, and to beg him personally that he and his nephew should not be long so entirely separated. This part of his letter was distinct, and probably his own."
"Heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then. 'I do not ask,' he said, 'that she may visit here; but am I never to see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you that my father's character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.","Heathcliff knew he could eloquently seek Catherine's company. ""I do not require,"" he said, ""that she come here; but shall I never see her again, for my father forbids me to go to her, and you forbid her to come to me?

We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you bear me no grudge: you have no reason to hate me, you yourself admit it. My dear uncle! Send me a kind note tomorrow, and come with me wherever you wish, except Thrushcross Grange. I think a conversation will convince you that my father's reputation is not mine: he claims I am your nephew rather than his son; and though I have faults that make me unworthy of Catherine, she has forgiven me, and for her sake you should do the same."""
"You inquire after my health - it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?' Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer, perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family. Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations. but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.","They ask me about my health: I am better; but how can I be cheerful and healthy while I am deprived of all hope, condemned to solitude or the company of those who have never loved me and never will? Edgar, while pitied by the boy, could not grant his request, as he could not accompany Catherine. He said they could meet this summer; in the meantime, he wished him to continue writing to him occasionally and promised to offer him as much advice and comfort as possible by letter, well aware of his difficult situation within his family. Linton complied; and had he not been restrained, he would probably have spoiled everything by filling his letters with complaints and lamentations. But his father kept a close eye on him; and, of course, he insisted that every line my master wrote be published. So instead of writing down his personal sufferings and anxieties, the subjects that constantly preoccupied him, he insisted on the cruel obligation of being separated from his friend and lover. and he kindly indicated that Mr. Linton must grant him an interview promptly, or he might fear that he was deliberately deceiving him by empty promises."
"Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he had a natural desire that she might retain - or at least return in a short time to - the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object.","Cathy was a valuable ally at home; and eventually, they persuaded my master to take a ride or a walk together, under my supervision, about once a week on the moors near the Grange. For in June, his condition was still deteriorating. Although he had set aside a portion of his income each year for my young wife's estate, he naturally wished her to retain her ancestral home, or at least return there soon. He saw his only chance of achieving this in a union with his heir. He did not know that his condition was deteriorating almost as rapidly as his own. And I don't think anyone else did: no doctor went to the Heights, and no one sought out Master Heathcliff to report his condition. For my part, I began to believe that my premonitions were false and that he must really be pulling himself together when he talked of rides and walks on the moors and seemed so determined to pursue his goal."
"I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death. SUMMER was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.","I could not imagine a father treating a dying child with such tyranny and cruelty as Heathcliff, as I later learned, to enforce this apparent zeal: his efforts redoubled while his greedy and cruel plans were threatened with death. Summer was past its peak when Edgar reluctantly yielded to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to meet his cousin. It was a sultry, oppressive day: without sun, but with a sky too dull and misty-looking to expect rain; and our rendezvous place had been fixed by the signpost at the crossroads."
"On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger, told us that, 'Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.' 'Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' I observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at once.' 'Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my companion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.' But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount, and leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed, - 'Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.","When we reached him, a herdsman's boy, sent as a messenger, told us, ""Master Linton was just this side of the Heights and would be very grateful if we went a little farther."" ""Then Master Linton has forgotten his uncle's first instructions,"" I remarked. ""He ordered us to stay within the grounds of the Grange, and off we go."" ""Good, we'll turn back as soon as we reach him,"" my companion replied. ""We're going home."" But when we reached him, barely 400 meters from his house, we found he had no horse. We had to dismount and let ours graze. He lay on the moor waiting for us and didn't get up for a few meters. He walked so weakly and looked so pale that I immediately called out, ""Master Heathcliff, you are not fit to walk this morning."""
"How ill you do look!' Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual? 'No - better - better!' he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed. 'But you have been worse,' persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw you last; you are thinner, and - ' 'I'm tired,' he interrupted, hurriedly. 'It is too hot for walking, let us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick - papa says I grow so fast.' Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her. 'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at cheerfulness. 'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than sunshine. Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and try mine.' Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.","""How sick you look!"" Catherine looked at him sadly and surprised: the cry of joy on her lips turned into one of concern; and the congratulations on their long-postponed meeting gave way to an anxious question: Was he worse than usual? ""No—better—better!"" he gasped tremblingly, holding her hand as if he needed it, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over hers; the emptiness around them transformed the dull expression they once shared into a wasted wildness. ""But you are worse,"" her cousin persisted; ""worse than the last time I saw you; you have grown thin and—"" ""I am tired,"" he interrupted hastily. ""It is too hot to walk, let us rest here. And I often feel sick in the mornings—Father says I am growing so fast."" Cathy sat down contentedly, and he leaned close against her. ""This is like your heaven,"" she said, trying to sound cheerful. ""Do you remember the two days we were supposed to spend there, and how we both enjoyed it? It's almost your day, only there are clouds, but they're so mild and temperate: more pleasant than sunshine. Next week, if possible, we'll go to Grange Park and try mine."" Linton didn't seem to remember what she was talking about and was obviously struggling to follow the conversation."
"His lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an insult.","Her disinterest in the subjects she discussed and her inability to contribute to his conversation were so obvious that she could not hide her disappointment. A vague change had affected her entire personality and demeanor. Irritability, which could have been transformed into affection, had given way to a careless apathy; she had less the capricious temper of a child who deliberately seeks to be annoyed than the self-centered, gloomy character of a hardened invalid who rejects consolation and considers the good humor of others an insult."
"Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at least.","Catherine, like me, understood that he felt our company was more of a punishment than a satisfaction, and she didn't hesitate to suggest their immediate departure. This suggestion jolted Linton out of his lethargy and plunged him into a strange state of excitement. He cast an anxious glance toward the Heights and begged them to stay for at least another half hour."
"CHAPTER XXVI 'But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you, I'd willingly stay.' 'Stay to rest yourself,' he replied. 'And, Catherine, don't think or say that I'm VERY unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?' 'I'll tell him that YOU say so, Linton. I couldn't affirm that you are,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth. 'And be here again next Thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze. 'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come - my best thanks, Catherine.","CHAPTER XXVI ""But I think,"" said Cathy, ""you would be better off at home than here; and I see I cannot now entertain you with my stories, songs, and chatter. You have grown wiser than I during these six months; you have little desire to entertain me now; otherwise, I would gladly stay, if I could entertain you."" ""Rest yourself,"" he replied. ""And, Catherine, don't think or say that I am VERY ill. It is the heavy weather and heat that makes me sleepy; and I walked a great deal alone before you came. Tell my uncle I am well, will you?"" ""I will tell him, Linton. I cannot confirm it,"" remarked my young wife, surprised at his persistence in this obvious lie. ""And come here again next Thursday,"" he continued, avoiding her astonished look. ""And thank him for letting you come."" My sincere thanks, Catherine."
"And - and, if you DID meet my father, and he asked you about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing - he'll be angry.' 'I care nothing for his anger,' exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its object. 'But I do,' said her cousin, shuddering. 'DON'T provoke him against me, Catherine, for he is very hard.' 'Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired. 'Has he grown weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?' Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy. 'Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last. 'I can't tell why we should stay. He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us back.' 'Well, we must not leave him asleep,' I answered; 'wait till lie wakes, and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to see poor Linton has soon evaporated!' 'Why did HE wish to see me?' returned Catherine. 'In his crossest humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious mood.","And—and, if you met my father and he asked you about me, don't let him think I've been unusually quiet and stupid: don't make a sad and dejected face, or he'll be angry."" ""I don't understand his anger,"" cried Cathy, thinking she would be the target of his fury. ""But I do,"" said her cousin, shuddering. ""Do NOT provoke him, Catherine, for he is very harsh."" ""Is he strict with you, Master Heathcliff?"" I asked. ""Has he grown tired of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred?"" Linton looked at me but did not answer. And after remaining by his side for another ten minutes, during which his sleepy head sank upon his breast and he uttered only groans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy sought solace in picking bilberry and shared the fruits of her research with me. She declined, for she saw that any further communication would only be tiring and irritating. ""Half an hour ago, Ellen?"" she finally whispered in my ear. ""I don't see why we should stay. He's asleep, and Papa will want us back."" ""Well, you mustn't let him sleep,"" I replied. ""Wait until he wakes up, and be patient. You were so eager to leave, but your desire to see poor Linton is fading fast!"" ""Why did he want to see me?"" Catherine replied. ""I used to like him better when he was a bit more surly than in his strange state now."""
"It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform - this interview - for fear his father should scold him. But I'm hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I'm glad he's better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.' 'You think HE IS better in health, then?' I said. 'Yes,' she answered; 'because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings, you know.","It's as if this conversation is a task he has to perform so his father doesn't scold him. But I'm certainly not doing Mr. Heathcliff any favors, whatever his reasons for imposing this penance on Linton. And while I'm glad he's better, I'm sorry he's much less kind and loving toward me. ""So he's better?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""because he always tried so hard to suffer, you know."""
"He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa; but he's better, very likely.' 'There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,' I remarked; 'I should conjecture him to be far worse.' Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if any one had called his name. 'No,' said Catherine; 'unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.' CHAPTER XXVI 'I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab above us. 'You are sure nobody spoke?' 'Quite sure,' replied his cousin. 'Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we separated in winter? If you be, I'm certain one thing is not stronger - your regard for me: speak, - are you?' The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, 'Yes, yes, I am!' And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner.","He is not as well as he told Papa; but he is probably better. ""You disagree, Miss Cathy,"" I remarked; ""I suppose he is much worse."" Linton started in alarm and asked if anyone had called him. ""No,"" said Catherine, ""except in a dream. I don't understand how anyone can fall asleep out of doors in the morning."" CHAPTER XXVI ""I thought I heard my father,"" he gasped, looking up at the high post above us. ""Are you sure no one said anything?"" ""Quite sure,"" replied his cousin. ""It was only Ellen and I who quarreled about your health. Are you really stronger, Linton, than when we parted in the winter?"" If so, I am sure one thing is not stronger: your esteem for me. Speak, won't you? Tears welled up in Linton's eyes as he answered, ""Yes, yes, I am!"" Still captivated by the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down, searching for the owner."
"Cathy rose. 'For to-day we must part,' she said. 'And I won't conceal that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I'll mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.' 'Hush,' murmured Linton; 'for God's sake, hush! He's coming.' And he clung to Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who obeyed her like a dog. 'I'll be here next Thursday,' she cried, springing to the saddle. 'Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!' And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was he in anticipating his father's approach. Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts about Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey would make us better judges.","Cathy stood up. ""We must part today,"" she said. ""And I will not conceal my deep disappointment at our meeting; though I will tell no one but you: not that I have the slightest respect for Mr. Heathcliff."" ""Hush,"" whispered Linton; ""for goodness' sake, hush! He's coming."" He clutched Catherine's arm and endeavored to restrain her; but at the announcement, she wrenched herself hastily free and whistled for Minny, who obeyed him like a dog. ""I'll be here next Thursday,"" she cried, springing into the saddle. ""Goodbye. Hurry, Ellen!"" Thus we left him, scarcely aware of our departure, so preoccupied was he with the prospect of his father's arrival. Before we reached the house, Catherine's discontent gave way to a confused feeling of pity and regret, mingled with vague and anxious doubts as to Linton's true situation, both physical and social. I attended, but advised her not to say too much, as we could form a better opinion after a second trip."
"My master requested an account of our ongoings. His nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal. SEVEN days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state.","My master asked me for a report on our activities. His cousin thanked him, and Miss Cathy carefully took care of the rest. I could hardly answer his questions, as I hardly knew what to hide or reveal. Seven days passed, and each one was marked by the rapid deterioration of Edgar Linton's condition."
"The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily - the brief period he could bear to sit up - and his chamber, had become her whole world.","The chaos wreaked a few months earlier was now repeated by the whims of the moment. We would have liked to deceive Catherine again, but her sharp mind did not fail her: she sensed this terrible probability and secretly pondered it, which gradually became a certainty. She was not allowed to speak of her Thursday ride; I told her and received permission to take her with me: the library, where her father spent a short time every day—the little time he could sit still—and her room had become her universe."
"She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death. He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.","She always regretted not being bent over his pillow or sitting by his side. Her face grew pale with sleeplessness and grief, and my master gladly sent her away, for what he flattered himself was a pleasant diversion and companionship, comforted by the hope that she would not be entirely alone after his death. Based on various observations, he was firmly convinced that his nephew would resemble him not only in appearance but also in spirit; for Linton's letters contained scarcely any hint of his faults."
"And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account. We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine's face was just like the landscape - shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.","And I, out of pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the mistake; I wondered what good it would do to disturb his last moments with information he had neither the power nor the opportunity to explain. We postponed our outing until the afternoon; a sunny August afternoon: every breath of the hills was so full of life that it seemed as if he who breathed it, even in dying, might come back to life. Catherine's face was like the landscape: shadows and sunshine passed swiftly across it; but the shadows lingered longer and the sunshine was more fleeting; and her poor little heart reproached itself for having briefly forgotten her cares."
"We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together. Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like fear. 'It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty. 'Is not your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come.' 'WHY won't you be candid?' cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. 'Why cannot you say at once you don't want me? It is strange, Linton, that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!' Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but his cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour. 'My father IS very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his bedside? Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you wished I wouldn't keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance attendance on your affectations now!' 'My affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they? For heaven's sake, Catherine, don't look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean for your anger.","We watched Linton from the spot he had chosen earlier. My young mistress dismounted and suggested that, as she was determined to stay a little longer, I should hold the pony and ride. But I disagreed: I did not want to lose sight of the mission entrusted to me for a moment. So we rode together up the moorland slope. Master Heathcliff received us with more enthusiasm this time: not with an expression of cheerfulness or joy; it sounded more like anxiety. ""It is late!"" he said briefly and laboriously. ""Isn't your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come."" ""WHY aren't you candid?"" cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. ""Why can't you just say you don't need me?"" ""It is strange, Linton, that you should have deliberately brought me here a second time, apparently to annoy us both, and for no reason at all!"" Linton shuddered and looked at her half pleadingly, half ashamed. But her cousin's patience wouldn't allow her to endure this scheming behavior. ""My father is gravely ill,"" she said, ""and why am I summoned to his bedside? Why didn't you release me from my promise when you wanted me to break it? Come! I need an explanation: fun and games are banished from my mind, and I can't dance to your affectations now!"" ""My affectations!"" he murmured, ""what is that? For heaven's sake, Catherine, don't be so angry! Despise me all you like; I am a coward and a vain creature; I cannot be despised enough, but I am too vile for your anger."""
"Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.' 'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion. 'Foolish, silly boy! And there! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him! You needn't bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from the hearth-stone, and pretending - what do we pretend? Let go my frock! If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity. Ellen, CHAPTER XXVII tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.","""Hate my father and spare me the contempt."" ""Nonsense!"" cried Catherine angrily. ""Silly, stupid boy! And there! He's trembling: as if I were really touching him! You needn't show contempt, Linton: he's spontaneously there for everyone. Go away! I'm going home: it's madness to tear you from the hearth and pretend—what are we pretending? Let go of my dress! If I felt sorry for you because you were crying and looked so frightened, you should reject such pity. Ellen, CHAPTER XXVII, tell him how shameful this behavior is."""
"Rise, and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile - DON'T!' With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror. 'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed! DEAR Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you. You'll not go, then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you WILL consent and he'll let me die with you!' My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him. The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed. 'Consent to what?' she asked. 'To stay! tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will.","""Stand up and do not degrade yourself to a contemptible reptile—NO!"" With tears in his eyes and an expression of mortal anguish, Linton threw his weakened body to the ground; he seemed contorted with fear. ""Oh!"" he sobbed. ""I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I am a traitor too, and I dare not tell you so! But leave me, and I will be killed! Dear Catherine, my life is in your hands. And you said you loved me, and if you did, it would do you no harm. So you will not go? Dear, dear, good Catherine! And perhaps you will agree, and he will let me die with you!"" My young wife, seeing his deep anguish, stooped to raise him. The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her anger, and she was deeply moved and troubled. ""Agree to what?"" she asked. ""Stay!"" Explain to me the meaning of this strange conversation, and I will do it."
"You contradict your own words, and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart. You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I'll believe you are a coward, for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.' 'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated fingers, 'and I dread him - I dread him! I DARE not tell!' 'Oh, well!' said Catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret: I'M no coward. Save yourself: I'm not afraid!' Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.","You contradict your own words and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once everything that is on your mind. You wouldn't hurt me, would you, Linton? You wouldn't allow an enemy to hurt me if you could help it? I think you are a coward to yourself, but not a treacherous coward to your best friend.' 'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clenching his emaciated fingers, 'and I am afraid of him—I am afraid of him! I dare not say anything!' 'Well!' said Catherine with contemptuous pity, 'keep your secret: I am not a coward. Run away: I am not afraid!' Her generosity brought tears to his eyes: he wept hot tears, kissed her supporting hands, and yet could not summon the courage to speak."
"I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when, hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn't cast a glance towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he said 'It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange? Let us hear.","I pondered the secret and decided that, despite my best wishes, Catherine could never do him or anyone else a favor. Hearing a rustling in the bars, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff coming down the hills almost beside us. He didn't even glance at my companions, although they were close enough to hear Linton's sobs. But he greeted me in an almost cordial tone, one he never adopted for anyone else, and the sincerity of which I could not deny, and said, ""It's strange to see you so near my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange? Keep me informed."""
"The rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone, 'that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his illness?' 'No; my master is dying,' I replied: 'it is true enough. A sad thing it will be for us all, but a blessing for him!' 'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked. 'I don't know,' I said. 'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed under his eye - Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account - 'because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game long? I DID give him some lessons about snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?' 'Lively? no - he has shown the greatest distress,' I answered. 'To see him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.' 'He shall be, in a day or two,' muttered Heathcliff. 'But first - get up, Linton! Get up!' he shouted. 'Don't grovel on the ground there up, this moment!' CHAPTER XXVII Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused by his father's glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing else to produce such humiliation.","""There's a rumor going around,"" he added quietly, ""that Edgar Linton is dying. Are they exaggerating his illness?"" ""No, my master is dying,"" I replied, ""that's true. It will be sad news for us all, but a blessing for him!"" ""How much longer do you think he will last?"" he asked. ""I don't know,"" I answered. ""Because,"" he continued, looking at the two young people who stood quite motionless under his gaze—Linton didn't seem to move or lift his head, and Catherine couldn't move on his account—""because that boy over there seems determined to hit me; and I'd be grateful to his uncle if he'd hurry up and get there first! Hello! Has the little dog been playing this game for long? I've given him a few lessons in whining. Is he generally quite lively with Miss Linton?"" ""Lively?"" ""No, he has shown great distress,"" I answered. ""Looking at him, instead of wandering about in the mountains with his sweetheart, he should be in bed under the care of a doctor."" ""He'll be here in a day or two,"" murmured Heathcliff. ""But first, get up, Linton! Get up!"" he cried. ""Don't crawl down there now!"" CHAPTER XXVII Linton had sunk to the ground again, in a fresh fit of helpless fear, triggered, I suppose, by his father's look: nothing else could humble him so much."
"He made several efforts to obey, but his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf. 'Now,' said he, with curbed ferocity, 'I'm getting angry and if you don't command that paltry spirit of yours DAMN you! get up directly!' 'I will, father,' he panted. 'Only, let me alone, or I shall faint. I've done as you wished, I'm sure.","He tried several times to obey, but his feeble strength left him for a moment, and he fell back with a groan. Mr. Heathcliff came forward, picked him up, and leaned him against a grass verge. ""Now,"" he said with suppressed anger, ""I'm going to have a fit, and if you don't control yourself, damn it! Get up right now!"" ""I will, Father,"" he gasped. ""Leave me alone, or I'll faint. I did what you wanted, I'm sure of it."""
"Catherine will tell you that I - that I - have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.' 'Take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet. There now - she'll lend you her arm: that's right, look at her.","Catherine will tell you that I... that I... had fun. Oh! Stay with me, Catherine; give me your hand. ""Take mine,"" said her father; ""stay there. Stay there, she'll lend you her arm; yes, look at her."""
"You would imagine I was the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.' 'Linton dear!' whispered Catherine, 'I can't go to Wuthering Heights: papa has forbidden me. He'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?' 'I can never re-enter that house,' he answered. 'I'm NOT to re- enter it without you!' 'Stop!' cried his father. 'We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.","One would think I were the devil himself, Miss Linton, for arousing such terror. Would you be so kind as to escort him home? He trembles when I touch him. ""Dear Linton!"" whispered Catherine. ""I cannot go to Wuthering Heights. Father has forbidden me. He will not harm you. Why are you so afraid?"" ""I can never set foot in that house again!"" he replied. ""I must NOT leave without you!"" ""Stop!"" cried her father. ""We will respect Catherine's childish scruples."""
"Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor, without delay.' 'You'll do well,' replied I. 'But I must remain with my mistress: to mind your son is not my business.' 'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know that: but you'll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?' He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.","Nelly, take him home; I will follow your advice about the doctor at once.' 'You will be well,' I replied. 'But I must stay with my mistress; the care of your son is none of my business.' 'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know, but you force me to pinch the baby and let it cry before it awakens your compassion. Come then, my hero. Will you come back, in my company?' He came towards me again, making as if to seize the defenseless creature; but Linton shrank back, clinging to his cousin, and imploring her with a desperate, implacable persistence to accompany him."
"However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy. We reached the threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed - 'My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me to shut the door.' He shut and locked it also. I started. 'You shall have tea before you go home,' he added. 'I am by myself.","For all my disapproval, I could not dissuade her: how could she have rejected him? What frightened him so much, we could not discover; yet there he stood, helpless under her sway, and the slightest hint seemed to drive him mad. We reached the threshold; Catherine entered, and I waited while she led the sick man to a chair, only to let him go immediately. Then Mr. Heathcliff called out, pushing me forward: ""My house is free from the plague, Nelly; and I want to welcome you today: sit down, I'll shut the door."" He closed and locked it. I shuddered. ""You shall have some tea before you go in,"" he added. ""I am alone."""
"Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton, take your seat by HIM. I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer.","Hareton has gone to the Lees' with cattle, and Zillah and Joseph are making a pleasant journey. Although I am accustomed to being alone, I would like some interesting company. Miss Linton, sit beside him. I will give you what I have: the gift is hardly worth mentioning; but I have nothing else to offer you."
"It is Linton, I mean. How she does stare! It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening's amusement.' He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'By hell! I hate them.' 'I am not afraid of you!' exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution. 'Give me that key: I will have it!' she said. 'I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.' CHAPTER XXVII Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.","I mean, it's Linton. How she stares at me! It's strange how angry I am at everything that seems to frighten me! Were I born in a district where the laws were less strict and tastes less refined, I would treat myself to a slow vivisection of these two for evening entertainment. He gasped, pounded the table, and cursed: ""Goodness! I hate them."" ""I'm not afraid of you!"" cried Catherine, who didn't hear the end of his speech. She came closer, her black eyes flashing with passion and determination. ""Give me the key, I want it!"" she said. ""I wouldn't eat or drink here, even if I had to starve."" CHAPTER XXVII Heathcliff held the key in his hand, which still lay on the table."
"He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered it speedily. 'Now, Catherine Linton,' he said, 'stand off, or I shall knock you down; and, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.' Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents again. 'We will go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.","He looked up, astonished by her audacity; perhaps her voice and her gaze reminded him of the person who had given her this gift. She seized the instrument and just managed to pry it from his fingers; but her gesture brought him back to the present; he quickly snatched it back. ""Now, Catherine Linton,"" he said, ""keep your distance, or I'll hit you; and that will make Mrs. Dean furious."" Despite this warning, she once more seized his closed hand and its contents. ""Let's go!"" she repeated, trying to relax her steely muscles; and when she found that her nails left no mark, she set her teeth rather sharply. Heathcliff looked at me, a look that for a moment prevented me from interrupting him."
"Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.' At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. 'You villain!' I began to cry, 'you villain!' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on.","Catherine was too engrossed in her fingers to notice his face. He opened them abruptly, giving up the argument; but before she could take them, he seized them with his free hand, placed them over his knee, and with the other delivered a series of terrible blows on both sides of the head, each of which would have been enough to carry out his threat if she had been dropped. Faced with such diabolical violence, I rushed at him in fury. ""You filthy scoundrel!"" I began to scream, ""you filthy scoundrel!"" A touch on the chest silenced me: I am fat and catch my breath fast; and between that and the rage, I staggered back dizzy, close to suffocation or the bursting of a vein. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, freed, placed both hands on her temples, as if she didn't know whether her ears were all right or not."
"She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered. 'I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly, as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor. 'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall be your father, to-morrow - all the father you'll have in a few days - and you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you're no weakling: you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!' Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had alighted on another than him.","She trembled like a reed, the poor creature, and leaned against the table in utter bewilderment. ""I know how to raise children,"" said the villain grimly, bending down to pick up the key that had fallen on the floor. ""Now go to Linton, as I told you, and cry as much as you like! Tomorrow I shall be your father—the father you will have in a few days—and you shall have a pocketful of it. You may have a pocketful of it; you are no weakling: you shall feel the effects every day when I see that devilish anger in your eyes again!"" Cathy rushed to me instead of Linton, knelt down, and laid her burning cheek on my knee, crying her eyes out. Her cousin had crept quietly into a corner of the sofa and was, I dare say, glad that the punishment had fallen on someone other than himself."
"Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and handed me a cup. 'Wash away your spleen,' he said. 'And help your own naughty pet and mine.","Mr. Heathcliff, seeing how confused we all were, got up and quickly made tea himself. Cups and saucers were ready. He poured the tea and handed me a cup. ""Wash your spleen,"" he said. ""And help your ugly little pet and mine."""
"It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I'm going out to seek your horses.' Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the windows - they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure. 'Master Linton,' I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box your ears, as he has done your cousin's.' 'Yes, Linton, you must tell,' said Catherine. 'It was for your sake I came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.' 'Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,' he answered. 'Mrs. Dean, go away.","It's not poisoned, although I prepared it. I'll get your horses."" When he left, our first thought was to force our way out somewhere. We tried the kitchen door, but it was locked from the outside; we looked toward the windows—they were too narrow, even for Cathy's slight figure. ""Master Linton,"" I cried, seeing that we were often locked in, ""you know what your devilish father is up to, and you will tell us, or I will beat you as he beat your cousin."" ""Yes, Linton, you must tell us,"" said Catherine. ""I came for your sake, and it would be terribly ungrateful of you to refuse."" ""Give me some tea, I am thirsty, and then I will tell you,"" he replied. ""Mrs. Dean, go."""
"I don't like you standing over me. Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won't drink that.","I don't like it when you lie on top of me. And now, Catherine, let your tears fall into my glass. I won't drink that."
"Give me another.' Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears. 'Papa wants us to be married,' he continued, after sipping some of the liquid. 'And he knows your papa CHAPTER XXVII wouldn't let us marry now; and he's afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you shall return home next day, and take me with you.' 'Take you with her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed. 'YOU marry? Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.","""Give me another,"" Catherine pushed another toward him and wiped her face. The little brat's coldness disgusted me, for he was no longer afraid of himself. The fear he had shown on the moor had disappeared as soon as he entered Wuthering Heights; so I suspected he was in danger of a terrible tantrum if he failed to lure us there; and once that happened, he was no longer immediately afraid. ""Papa wants us to be married,"" he continued after he had drunk some of the drink. ""And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's afraid I'll die if we wait; so we must be married tomorrow morning, and you must stay here all night; and if you do as he wishes, you can come back the next day and take me away."" ""Go and get married, you poor changeling!"" I cried. ""Do you want to get married? That man is crazy! Or he thinks we're all stupid."""
"And do you imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the notion that anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks: and - don't look so silly, now! I've a very good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile conceit.' I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me. 'Stay all night? No,' she said, looking slowly round. 'Ellen, I'll burn that door down but I'll get out.' And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing:- 'Won't you have me, and save me? not let me come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave, after all. You MUST obey my father - you MUST!' 'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel suspense.","And do you think this beautiful young woman, this healthy girl, would care for a dying little monkey like you? Do you think anyone, least of all Miss Catherine Linton, would want you as a husband? You deserve to be whipped for bringing us here with your cowardly wiles: and... don't play dumb! I want to shake you violently for your contemptible treachery and foolish self-importance. I shook him gently, but that set off a coughing fit, and he began to waile and cry again, and Catherine rebuked me. ""Stay all night? No,"" she said, looking around slowly. ""Ellen, I'll burn this door, but I'll get out again."" And she would have carried out her threat immediately, but Linton panicked again. He clutched her with both weak arms and sobbed, ""Won't you take me and save me?"" Won't you let me come to the estate? Oh, dear Catherine! You can't just leave like that. You MUST obey my father, you MUST! ""I must obey my father,"" she replied, ""and free him from this cruel uncertainty."""
"The whole night! What would he think? He'll be distressed already. I'll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You're in no danger; but if you hinder me - Linton, I love papa better than you!' The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored to the boy his coward's eloquence.","All night! What would he think? He'd be upset already. I'd break in or overexert myself. Be calm! You're not in danger; but if you bother me—Linton, I love Papa more than you! The mortal anguish he felt at Mr. Heathcliff's fury revived the boy's cowardly eloquence."
"Catherine was near distraught: still, she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus occupied, our jailor re- entered. 'Your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and - now Linton! snivelling again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come - have done, and get to bed. In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.","Catherine was almost in despair. Nevertheless, she insisted on going home and, in turn, tried to persuade him to end his selfish suffering. Meanwhile, our jailer had returned. ""Your beasts have run away,"" he said, ""and now, Linton! Is he sobbing again? What has she done to you? Come, come, come, lie down. In a month or two, my boy, you can pay her back."""
"You're pining for pure love, are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There, to bed! Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush! hold your noise! Once in your own room, I'll not come near you: you needn't fear. By chance, you've managed tolerably.","You want pure love, don't you? Nothing else in the world: And she'll have you! Off to bed! Zillah won't be here tonight; you must undress. Quiet! Quiet! Once I'm in your room, I won't go near you again: you needn't be afraid. You seem to have done quite well."
"I'll look to the rest.' He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent.","""I'll take care of the rest,"" he said, holding the door open for his son. He climbed out like a spaniel, suspecting the man helping him of plotting something. The lock was locked. Heathcliff went to the fireplace, where my mistress and I remained silent."
"Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness, but he scowled on her and muttered - 'Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!' 'I AM afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if I stay, papa will be miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable - when he - when he - Mr. Heathcliff, let ME go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do what I'll willingly do of myself?' 'Let him dare to force you,' I cried. 'There's law in the land, thank God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.","Catherine looked up and instinctively placed her hand on her cheek; the proximity was painful. Anyone else would not have been able to view this childish act with severity, but he stared at her and murmured, ""Oh! Are you not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised: you seem dreadfully frightened!"" ""I am afraid now,"" she answered, ""for if I stay, Papa will be unhappy: and how can I bear to make him unhappy? If he—if he—Mr. Heathcliff, let me go home! I promise to marry Linton: Papa would wish it; and I love him. Why should you force me to do what I naturally love?"" ""Let him dare to force you,"" I cried. ""There is justice in this country, thank God! It exists, even if we are in a lonely place."""
"I'd inform if he were my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!' 'Silence!' said the ruffian. 'To the devil with your clamour! I don't want YOU to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing CHAPTER XXVII me that such an event would follow.","I'd tell him if he were my own son: and that's a crime beyond the clergy! ""Quiet!"" said the villain. ""To hell with your shouting! I won't let you speak. Miss Linton, the thought of your father being unhappy will amuse me greatly. I won't be able to sleep to calm myself. You couldn't have imagined a better way to live under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than to inform me that something like this was going to happen."""
"As to your promise to marry Linton, I'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.' 'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly. 'Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he'll think we're lost. What shall we do?' 'Not he! He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a little amusement,' answered Heathcliff. 'You cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary.","As for your promise to marry Linton, I will see that you keep it; for you must not leave this place until you have fulfilled it. ""Then send Ellen to Papa and tell him I am safe!"" cried Catherine, weeping bitterly. ""Or marry me now. Poor Papa! Ellen, he will think we are doomed. What shall we do?"" ""No! He will think you are tired of waiting for him and will run away to amuse yourself a little,"" replied Heathcliff. ""You cannot deny that you came to my house of your own free will, despite his orders to the contrary."""
"And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man ONLY your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as HE went out of it.","And it's only natural that at your age you need entertainment; and that you're tired of caring for a sick man, and that man was only your father. Catherine, his best days were over when yours began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (at least, I did); and it should be normal that he cursed you when he left this world."
"I'd join him. I don't love you! How should I? Weep away. As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he may.","I'd go with him. I don't love you! How could I? Cry. The way I see it, that will be your main occupation in the future; unless Linton makes up for other losses: and your caring parents seem to think so."
"His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind - that's paternal.","His letters, full of advice and comfort, brought me great joy. In his last letter, he advised my little darling to be gentle with her family and kind to her when he received her. Caring and kind—that is the nature of a father."
"But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself. Linton can play the little tyrant well. He'll undertake to torture any number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.","But Linton needs all their attention and kindness. Linton can be a real little bully. He's ready to torture any cat, pull out its teeth, and clip its claws."
"You'll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his KINDNESS, when you get home again, I assure you.' 'You're right there!' I said; 'explain your son's character. Show his resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice!' 'I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,' he answered; 'because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed, here.","""You'll have wonderful stories to tell his uncle about his kindness when you return, I assure you."" ""You're right!"" I said. ""Explain your son's character to him. Show him how much he resembles you. Then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before taking the basilisk away from him!"" ""I have no qualms about speaking of his lovable qualities now,"" he replied. ""For she must accept it or remain a prisoner, and you with her, until your master dies. I can keep you both here, completely hidden."""
"If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have an opportunity of judging!' 'I'll not retract my word,' said Catherine. 'I'll marry him within this hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff, you're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from MERE malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live? I've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me! No, don't turn away!

I have stopped crying; but I will kneel here beside you; and I will not rise again, nor take my eyes off you, until you look at me again! No, do not turn! LOOK!

"I don't hate you. I'm not angry that you struck me. Have you never loved ANYBODY in all your life, uncle? NEVER? Ah! you must look once.","I don't hate you. I'm not mad that you hit me. You've never loved anyone, Uncle? Never? Ah! You should see this."
"I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.' 'Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!' cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. 'I'd rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I DETEST you!' He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.","I'm so unhappy you can't help feeling sorry for me. ""Hands off and go away, or I'll kick you!"" cried Heathcliff, pushing her roughly away. ""I'd rather be entwined by a snake. How can you flatter me? I despise you!"" He shrugged his shoulders, shook himself, as if his skin were rising from his heart, and pushed back his chair, while I stood up and opened my mouth to unleash a torrent of insults. But in the middle of the first sentence, I was silenced on the next syllable by the threat of being taken into a room alone."
"It was growing dark - we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host hurried out instantly: HE had his wits about him; WE had not. There was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone. 'I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,' I observed to Catherine. 'I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?' 'It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,' said Heathcliff, overhearing me. 'You should have opened a lattice and called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't.","It was getting dark; we heard voices at the garden gate. Our host hurried out; he had regained his senses, but we hadn't. We chatted for a few minutes, then he came back alone. ""I thought it was your cousin Hareton,"" I said to Catherine.

""You should have opened a gate and called, but I swear this fellow is glad you didn't."""
"She's glad to be obliged to stay, I'm certain.' CHAPTER XXVII At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock. Then he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.","She's glad to stay, I'm sure."" CHAPTER XXVII When we learned what a chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief, and he let us weep until nine o'clock. Then he ordered us to go up through the kitchen to Zillah's room, and I whispered to my companion to obey: perhaps we could manage to get in by the window, or into a garret and out by the skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like the one below, and the garret was safe from our attempts, for we were stuck there as before."
"We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.","None of us lay down. Catherine took her place by the railing and waited longingly for morning. A deep sigh was the only response I could elicit from her to my constant pleas to rest. I sat in a chair and rocked back and forth, severely assessing my many derelictions of duty. From this, it occurred to me, came all the misadventures of my employers. In reality, this was not the case, I know, but in my imagination, it was that dark night; and I considered Heathcliff himself less guilty than I."
"At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She ran to the door immediately, and answered, 'Yes.' 'Here, then,' he said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again.","At seven o'clock he came and asked if Miss Linton had gotten up. She immediately ran to the door and answered, ""Yes."" ""There you are,"" he said, opened the door, and pulled her out. I got up to follow her, but he turned the lock again."
"I demanded my release. 'Be patient,' he replied; 'I'll send up your breakfast in a while.' I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's. 'I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' door!' Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day. 'Tak' it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand. 'Stay one minute,' I began. 'Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to detain him. And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night; and another, and another.","I demanded my release. ""Be patient,"" he replied, ""I'll bring you breakfast right away."" I knocked on the door and shook the bolt furiously. Catherine asked me why I was still locked up. He replied, ""I must endure another hour,"" and they left. I held out for two or three hours; finally, I heard a step: not Heathcliff's. ""I've brought you food,"" said a voice, ""open the door!"" I obeyed eagerly and saw Hareton, laden with provisions for the whole day. ""Take it,"" he added, pressing the tray into my hand. ""Wait a moment,"" I began. ""No,"" he cried, withdrawing, despite all my entreaties to stop him. And I remained locked there all day, and all the next night; and another, and another."
"Five nights and four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion. ON the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached - lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm. 'Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!' she exclaimed. 'Well! there is a talk about you at Gimmerton.","I stayed a total of five nights and four days, and every morning I saw no one except Hareton. He was the very image of a jailer: sullen, mute, and deaf to any attempt to influence his sense of justice or his compassion. On the fifth morning, or rather the afternoon, another step approached, lighter and shorter; and this time the figure entered the room. It was Zillah, wrapped in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk hood over her head and a wicker basket on her arm. ""Hey, my dear! Mrs. Dean!"" she exclaimed. ""Why! There's a lecture about you at Gimmerton."""
"I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But you're not so thin - you've not been so poorly, have you?' 'Your master is a true scoundrel!' I replied. 'But he shall answer for it. He needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!' 'What do you mean?' asked Zillah. 'It's not his tale: they tell that in the village - about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw, when I come in - ""Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I went off. It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean."" He stared.","I never thought you and Miss would sink with you in Blackhorse Marsh, until Master told me you'd been found and brought back! What? And you had to land on an island, didn't you? And how long were you down there? Did Master rescue you, Mrs. Dean? But you're not that thin, you weren't that sick, were you?' 'Your master's a real scoundrel!' I answered. 'But he'll get even with you. He didn't have to tell the story: it'll all come out in the end!' 'What do you mean?' asked Zillah. 'It's not his story: they tell it in the village, how you were lost in the marsh; and I call out to Earnshaw as I come in: ""Er, strange things have been happening, Mr. Hareton, since I've been gone."" It's a shame about the girl, probably still young, and Nelly Dean.' He stared at me."
"I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said, ""If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room.","I thought he hadn't heard anything, so I told him the rumor. The master listened, smiled to himself, and said, ""If they were in the swamp, they're out there, Zillah. Nelly Dean is in your room right now."""
"You can tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire's funeral.""' 'Mr. Edgar is not dead?' I gasped. 'Oh! Zillah, Zillah!' 'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right sickly yet.","Tell her to run when you come up; here is the key. The swamp water was up to her head, and she would have rushed home; but I helped her until she came to her senses. Tell her, if she is able, to go at once to the manor and deliver a message from me, which her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire's funeral. ""Mr. Edgar is not dead?"" I gasped. ""Oh! Zillah, Zillah!"" ""No, no; sit down, my good lady,"" she answered; ""you are still very ill."""
"He's not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another day. I met him on the road and asked.' Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine.","He's not dead; Dr. Kenneth thinks he can last another day. I met him on the way and asked him about it. Instead of sitting down, I grabbed my outdoor gear and ran downstairs, since the street was clear. As I entered the house, I looked around for someone who could tell me something about Catherine."
"The place was filled with sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle, sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes. 'Where is Miss Catherine?' I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, alone.","The room was bathed in sunlight, and the door stood wide open, but no one seemed to be there. As I hesitated whether to leave immediately or return to my mistress, a soft cough drew my attention to the fireplace. Linton lay alone on the sofa, sucking on cotton candy and watching my every move with a dispassionate expression. ""Where is Miss Catherine?"" I asked sternly, hoping to surprise him alone and bring him to his senses."
"He sucked on like an innocent. 'Is she gone?' I said. 'No,' he replied; 'she's upstairs: she's not to go; we won't let her.' 'You won't let her, little idiot!' I exclaimed. 'Direct me to her room immediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply.' 'Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,' he answered. 'He says I'm not to be soft with Catherine: she's my wife, and it's shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan't have it: and she shan't go home! She never shall! - she may cry, and be sick as much as she pleases!' He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to drop asleep. 'Master Heathcliff,' I resumed, 'have you forgotten all Catherine's kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through CHAPTER XXVIII wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you know he detests you both. And you join him against her.","He sucked innocently. ""Is she gone?"" I asked. ""No,"" he answered. ""She's upstairs; she mustn't go; we won't let her go."" ""You won't let her go, you idiot!"" I cried. ""Send me to her room at once, or I'll make you sing your heart out."" ""Papa would make you sing your heart out if you tried to leave,"" he answered. ""He says I shouldn't be nice to Catherine; she's my wife, and it's a pity she wants to leave me. He says she hates me and wants to kill me for my money; but she won't, and she'll never come back! She'll never come back! She can cry and vomit all she wants!"" He resumed his usual activities and closed his eyelids as if he were about to fall asleep. ""Master Heathcliff,"" I continued, ""have you forgotten Catherine's kindness last winter, when you declared your love for her, when she brought you books, sang songs for you, and often visited you despite the wind and snow? Chapter 28 She wept one night because you would be disappointed, and you thought then she was a hundred times too good for you. And now you believe your father's lies, even though you know he hates you both. And you ally yourself with him against her."""
"That's fine gratitude, is it not?' The corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his lips. 'Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?' I continued. 'Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you will have any. And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up there in a strange house! You who have felt what it is to be so neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too; but you won't pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see - an elderly woman, and a servant merely - and you, after pretending such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you're a heartless, selfish boy!' 'I can't stay with her,' he answered crossly. 'I'll not stay by myself.","""That's a great gratitude, isn't it?"" Linton's lips drooped, and he took the candy from his lips. ""Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?"" I continued. ""Think for yourself! As for your money, she doesn't even know you're getting it. And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up there in a strange house! You, who know what it is to be neglected like that! You may pity your own sorrow; and her too; but you won't pity hers! I have shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see—an old woman and a lowly servant—and you, after feigning so much affection, and having almost reason to adore her, keep all your tears to yourself and sit quite still. Ah! You are a heartless, selfish wretch!"" ""I cannot stay with her,"" he retorted angrily. ""I will not stay alone."""
"She cries so I can't bear it. And she won't give over, though I say I'll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn't sleep.' 'Is Mr. Heathcliff out?' I inquired, perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his cousin's mental tortures. 'He's in the court,' he replied, 'talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says uncle is dying, truly, at last.","She cries so much that I can't bear it. And she doesn't stop, even when I say I'm calling my father. I called him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she didn't shut up; but as soon as he left the room, she started crying again and moaned all night, while I screamed in rage because I couldn't sleep. ""Isn't Mr. Heathcliff at home?"" I asked, seeing that the unfortunate creature felt no pity for her nephew's mental anguish. ""He's at court,"" he replied, ""speaking to Doctor Kenneth; he says his uncle is really dying."""
"I'm glad, for I shall be master of the Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as her house. It isn't hers! It's mine: papa says everything she has is mine.","I'm happy because after him, I'll be the mistress of the Grange. Catherine always called it her home. It's not hers! It's mine: Papa says everything she owns is mine."
"All her nice books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but I told her she had nothing to give, they ware all, all mine. And then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday - I said they were mine, too; and tried to get them from her.","All her beautiful books belong to me. She offered to give them to me, along with her pretty birds and her pony Minny, if I took the key to our room from her and let them out. But I told her she had nothing to give, they were all mine. Then she started to cry, took out a small picture she wore around her neck, and said I could have it. Two pictures in a little gold box, one of her mother and one of her uncle when they were little. That was yesterday. I said they were mine too, and tried to take them away from her."
"The spiteful thing wouldn't let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked out - that frightens her - she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the case, and gave me her mother's portrait; the other she attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me; she refused, and he - he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot.' 'And were you pleased to see her struck?' I asked: having my designs in encouraging his talk. 'I winked,' he answered: 'I wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse, he does it so hard.","The cruel creature wouldn't let me go; she pushed me away and hurt me. I screamed—it frightened her—when she heard Papa coming, broke the hinges, snapped the suitcase in half, and handed me her mother's portrait. She tried to hide the other one, but Papa asked me what was wrong, and I explained. He took the portrait from me and ordered her to give me hers. She refused, and he—he pushed her over, tore it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot. ""And you agreed to her being beaten?"" I asked, to encourage him. ""I winked,"" he replied. ""I wink when I see my father beat a dog or a horse; he does it so brutally."""
"Yet I was glad at first - she deserved punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain. I don't like to think so; but she's a naughty thing for crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid of her.' 'And you can get the key if you choose?' I said. 'Yes, when I am up-stairs,' he answered; 'but I can't walk up- stairs now.' 'In what apartment is it?' I asked. 'Oh,' he cried, 'I shan't tell YOU where it is. It is our secret.","At first I was glad: she deserved the punishment for pushing me. But when Dad was gone, she took me to the window and showed me the cut on the inside of her cheek where her teeth had been, and her mouth full of blood. Then she picked up the picture pieces, sat down facing the wall, and hasn't spoken to me since. And sometimes I think she can't speak for the pain. I don't like that thought; but she's a horrible creature, crying all the time; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid for her. ""And can you have the key if you want?"" I said. ""Yes, when I get upstairs,"" he replied. ""But I can't go up now."" ""Which apartment is it in?"" I asked. ""Oh,"" he cried, ""I won't tell you where it is. It's our secret."""
"Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you've tired me - go away, go away!' And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again. CHAPTER XXVIII I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a rescue for my young lady from the Grange.","No one, neither Hareton nor Zillah, was allowed to know. ""Look! You've completely exhausted me, go away, go away!"" And he turned his head toward his arm and closed his eyes again. CHAPTER XXVIII I thought it best to go away without seeing Mr. Heathcliff and try to rescue my young wife from the Grange."
"On reaching it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door: but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him, even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least.","Upon their arrival, my colleagues were overjoyed and thrilled to see me. When they learned that their little mistress was well, two or three rushed to Mr. Edgar's door to tell him the news; but I broke the news myself. How much he seemed to have changed in just a few days! Sad and resigned, he lay there, waiting for death. He looked very young: although he was thirty-nine, you would have thought he was at least ten years younger."
"He thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and spoke. 'Catherine is coming, dear master!' I whispered; 'she is alive and well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.' I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up, looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at the Heights.","He was thinking of Catherine, for he whispered her name. I touched his hand and spoke. ""Catherine is coming, dear sir!"" I murmured. ""She is well and hearty; I hope she will come this evening."" I trembled at the first news; he half rose, looked around the apartment, and then fell back, dazed. As soon as he came to, I told him about our obligatory visit and our imprisonment in the Heights."
"I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe all his father's brutal conduct - my intentions being to add no bitterness, if I could help it, to his already over-flowing cup. He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.","I said Heathcliff had forced me to go in, which wasn't entirely true. I told Linton as little as possible about this, nor did I describe his father's brutality; my intention was, if possible, not to aggravate his already overflowing grief. He suspected that his enemy intended to bequeath the personal property and possessions to his son, or rather to himself; but why he hadn't waited until his death remained a mystery to my master, for he didn't know how close he and his nephew would become."
"However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die. Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of her jailor.","However, he felt his will could be better amended: instead of leaving Catherine's estate to herself, he decided to leave it to trustees for her to dispose of during her lifetime and for her children, if any came after her. Thus, in the event of Linton's death, the estate could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff. After receiving his instructions, I sent a man to fetch the lawyer and four other men equipped with serviceable weapons to requisition my young wife from her jailer."
"Both parties were delayed very late. The single servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.","Both parties were kept waiting until late into the night. The only servant returned first. He announced that Mr. Green, the lawyer, would be out when he arrived and would have to wait two hours for his return. Mr. Green then informed him that he had some business in the village but would arrive at Thrushcross Grange before morning."
"The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us.","The four men also returned alone. They announced that Catherine was ill; too ill to leave her room; and Heathcliff wouldn't allow them to visit her. I gave these fools a good dressing down for listening to this story, which I refused to tell my master. I decided to go to the high ground with a whole party in broad daylight and attack them head-on, unless we could discreetly surrender ourselves to the prisoners."
"Her father SHALL see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it! Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone down-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump. 'Oh! it is Green,' I said, recollecting myself - 'only Green,' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.","Her father will see her, I swore again and again, if that devil dies at her door trying to stop her! Fortunately, I was spared the trip and the trouble. I had gone downstairs at three o'clock to fetch a pitcher of water and was crossing the hall with it when a sharp knock at the front door startled me. ""Oh! It's Green,"" I said, and stopped again—""Only Green,"" and moved on, intending to send someone else to open it; but the knock came again: not loud, but urgent. I placed the pitcher on the banister and hurried to let him in myself."
"The harvest moon shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, 'Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?' 'Yes,' I cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with us again!' She wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.","Outside, the full moon shone brightly. It wasn't the lawyer. My dear little mistress threw herself sobbing on my neck: ""Ellen, Ellen! Is Papa still alive?"" ""Yes,"" I cried, ""yes, my little angel, he is! Thank God you're safe with us again!"" Panting, she tried to climb the stairs to Mr. Linton's room, but I made her sit down, gave her something to drink, and washed her pale face, rubbing it with my apron to make it white."
"Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me she would not complain. I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.","I then told her I had to go first and tell her of his arrival; I asked her to tell me that she would be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared at me fixedly, but soon understood why I had told her this lie and assured me that she would not complain. I couldn't bear to be present at her meeting."
"I stood outside the chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed, then. All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as her father's joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed CHAPTER XXVIII dilating with ecstasy.","I stood at the bedroom door for fifteen minutes, hardly daring to approach the bed. But all was quiet: Catherine's despair was as unobtrusive as her father's joy. She seemed to be calmly supporting him; and he stared into her face, his eyes raised to heaven, wide with ecstasy."
"He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he murmured, - 'I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!' and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a struggle.","He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood; he died like this. He kissed her cheek and murmured, ""I will go to her; and you, my dear child, come to us!"" He moved no more, spoke no more; but he retained that rapturous, radiant look until his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul left him. No one could discern the exact moment of his death, so completely without struggle."
"Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master's summons.","Whether Catherine shed tears or her grief was too great to allow them to flow, she sat with dry eyes until sunrise. She remained there until noon and would still have been brooding on her deathbed if I had not insisted that she leave and rest. Fortunately, I managed to get her away, for around noon the lawyer who had come to Wuthering Heights to receive his instructions appeared. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff; that was why he had waited so long before answering my master's summons."
"Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter's mind, to disturb him, after his daughter's arrival. Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.","Fortunately, after his daughter's arrival, he no longer had any material worries. Mr. Green took it upon himself to put the house in order. He asked all the servants, except me, to leave."
"He would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay at the Grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.","He is said to have abused his delegated authority to such an extent that he demanded that Edgar Linton be buried not next to his wife, but in the chapel with his family. However, this was prevented, and I vehemently protested against any violation of the regulations. The funeral was rushed; Catherine, now Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, was allowed to remain at the Grange until her father's death."
"She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer. It drove her desperate.","She told me that her fear had finally driven Linton to risk his release. She had heard the men I had sent to the gate arguing and understood Heathcliff's reaction. She was desperate."
"Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole out before break of day.","Linton, who had been shown into the living room shortly after my departure, was terrified and wanted the key back before his father returned. He was clever enough to open and lock the door without closing it. And when he was supposed to be going to bed, he asked Hareton to sleep with him, and this time his request was granted. Catherine sneaked out before daybreak."
"She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances. THE evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the library; now musing mournfully - one of us despairingly - on our loss, now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.","She didn't dare open the doors for fear the dogs might raise the alarm. She visited the empty rooms and inspected the windows. Landing happily in her mother's room, she effortlessly climbed over the railing and climbed down through the neighboring fir tree. Her accomplice, despite his timid cunning, suffered for his involvement in the escape. The evening after the funeral, my young wife and I sat in the library, sometimes sad—one of us even despairing—reflecting on our loss, sometimes hypothesizing about a bleak future."
"We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a servant - one of the discarded ones, not yet departed - rushed hastily in, and said 'that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he fasten the door in his face? If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and availed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word.","We had just agreed that Catherine's best fate would be to be allowed to remain at the Grange, at least as long as Linton lived: he could come to her, and I could stay on as governess. This arrangement seemed too advantageous to hope for; and yet I hoped, and began to rejoice at the prospect of keeping my house, my position, and above all, my beloved young mistress. Then a servant—one of the servants who had come out and had not yet left—rushed across the yard crying, ""That confounded Heathcliff!"" Was he going to slam the door in her face? Had we been foolish enough to order him, we would not have had time. He did not bother to knock or give his name: he was the master and was exercising his right to enter without a word."
"The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door. It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.","Our informant's voice led him to the library; he entered, beckoned her out, and closed the door. It was the same room he had been greeted in eighteen years earlier: the same moon shone through the window, and the same autumn landscape stretched outside. We hadn't lit a candle yet, but the entire apartment was visible, even the portraits on the wall: the magnificent portrait of Mrs. Linton and the enchanting portrait of her husband."
"Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.","Heathcliff walked to the fireplace. His appearance, too, had changed little over time. He was still the same man: his dark face was a little paler and calmer, his figure perhaps a few pounds heavier, nothing more."
"Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him. 'Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm. 'No more runnings away! Where would you go? I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business: he's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.","Catherine had stood up, overcome by an urgent desire to run away when she saw him. ""Stop!"" he said, grabbing her arm. ""Don't run away again! Where are you going? I'll come for you; I hope you're a respectful girl and won't encourage my son to further disobedience. I was ashamed of the punishment I had to inflict on him when I discovered his involvement in this affair: he's such a cobweb that a little tweak would destroy him; but you can see from the look on his face that he got what he deserved! One evening, the day before yesterday, I took him downstairs and simply sat him down on a chair. I haven't touched him since. I sent Hareton away, and we had the room to ourselves."""
"In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.' 'Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton to her? As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.' 'I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services for her bread.","Two hours later, I called Joseph to carry him back upstairs. Since then, my presence has bothered him like a ghost. I suspect he sees me often, even when I'm not there. Hareton says he wakes up every night, howling, and calls you to protect him from me. Whether you love your dear companion or not, you must come. He is now in your care. I entrust my entire interest in him to you. ""Why don't you let Catherine stay here?"" I begged, ""and send Master Linton to her? Since you hate them both, you won't miss them. They can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart."" ""I seek a lodger for the Grange,"" he replied. ""And I want my children near me, that's for sure. Besides, this young lady owes me her services for her bread."""
"I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to compel you.' 'I shall,' said Catherine. 'Linton is all I have to love in the world, and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you cannot make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!' 'You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment, as long as it lasts.","I will not raise him in luxury and idleness when Linton is gone. So, prepare yourself quickly and do not force me to force you. ""I will,"" said Catherine. ""Linton is all I love now, and though you have done all you can to make him hate me and I hate him, you cannot make us hate each other. And I dare you to hurt him when I am near, and I dare you to frighten me!"" ""You are a boastful fighter,"" replied Heathcliff, ""but I do not love you enough to hurt him: you will taste the torment to the fullest while it lasts."""
"It is not I who will make him hateful to you - it is his own sweet spirit. He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.' 'I know he has a bad nature,' said Catherine: 'he's your son.","It is not I who makes him so hateful in your eyes, but his own kindness. He is bitter as gall because of your abandonment and its consequences: expect no thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him paint a beautiful picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as I am: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his mind to find a substitute for strength. ""I know he has a bad temper,"" said Catherine, ""he is your son."""
"But I'm glad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff YOU have NOBODY to love you; and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You ARE miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him? NOBODY loves you NOBODY will cry for you when you die! I wouldn't be you!' Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies. 'You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in- law, 'if you stand there another minute.","But I am glad to have a better one, one who forgives me; and I know he loves me, and therefore I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, you have NO ONE who loves you; and however unhappy you make us, we shall always revenge ourselves with the thought that your cruelty springs from your greater misery. You are unhappy, are you not? Lonely as the devil and jealous as he? NO ONE loves you. NO ONE will weep for you when you die! I would not be you! Catherine spoke with a sort of gloomy triumph: she seemed determined to adapt herself to the spirit of her future family and to revel in the grief of her enemies. ""You will be sorry,"" said her father-in-law, ""if you stay there a minute longer."""
"Begone, witch, and get your things!' She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.","""Go away, witch, and pack your things!"" She stepped back contemptuously. In his absence, I began to beg for Zillah's place on the hills and offered him mine; but he refused, regardless of the circumstances. He ordered me to be silent; then, for the first time, he allowed himself to look around the room and observe the paintings."
"Having studied Mrs. Linton's, he said - 'I shall have that home. Not because I need it, but - ' He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile - 'I'll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again - it is hers yet! - he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton's side, damn him! I wish he'd been soldered in lead.","After examining Mrs. Linton's grave, he said, ""I want this house. Not because I need it, but—"" He turned abruptly toward the fire and continued with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile: ""I'll tell you what I did yesterday! I asked the sexton who was digging Linton's grave to take the earth off the coffin lid, and I opened it. For a while, I thought I had stayed in it. When I saw his face again—it's still his!—he must have taken some pains to wake me. But he said it would change when the wind blew over it, so I tore off one side of the coffin and covered it up: not Linton's, for heaven's sake! I wish it had been soldered with lead."""
"And I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine out too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us he'll not know which is which!' 'You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I exclaimed; 'were you not ashamed to disturb the dead?' 'I disturbed nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I gave some ease to myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen years - incessantly - remorselessly - till yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil.","And I bribed the sexton to put it away while I'm lying there, and to put mine away too; I'll have them do that: and when Linton comes, he won't know what's the matter!' 'You've been very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I cried; 'weren't you ashamed to disturb the dead?' 'I didn't disturb anyone, Nelly,' he answered; 'and I've taken a little rest. I'll be much better now, and you'll have a better chance of keeping me underground when I get there. Disturbed you? No! She disturbed me, day and night, for eighteen years, without ceasing, without pause, until last night; and last night I was quiet.'"
"I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.' 'And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then?' I said. 'Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!' he answered. 'Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a transformation on raising the lid - but I'm better pleased that it should not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly have been removed. It began oddly.","I dreamed I was sleeping the last sleep of this sleeper, my heart still and my cheek frozen against hers. ""And if she had dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamed of?"" I asked. ""Dissolving with her and being even happier!"" he replied. ""Do you think I'm afraid of such a change? I expected such a transformation when I lifted the lid, but I'm glad it only begins when I share it. Besides, this strange feeling would hardly have disappeared if I hadn't had a distinct impression of her expressionless features. It began strangely."""
"You know I was wild after she died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as winter - all round was solitary.","You know, I went mad after her death and begged her endlessly, from sunrise to sunset, to give me back her spirit! I firmly believe in ghosts: I'm convinced they can live among us! On the day of her funeral, there was a blizzard. In the evening, I went to the cemetery. The wind was cold, like winter; one felt lonely everywhere."
"I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I said to myself - 'I'll have her in my arms again! If she be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills ME; and if she be motionless, it is sleep."" I got a spade from the tool-house, and began to delve with all my might - it scraped the coffin; I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down. ""If I can only get this off,"" I muttered, ""I wish they may shovel in the earth over us both!"" and I wrenched at it more desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear.","I wasn't afraid that her foolish husband would arrive in the valley so late; and no one else was allowed to take her there. Alone, and aware that two meters of soft earth formed the only barrier between us, I said to myself, ""I'll take her in my arms again! If she's cold, I think it's the north wind chilling me; and if she's quiet, she's asleep."" I grabbed a shovel from the tool shed and began digging with all my might: It scraped the coffin; I began working with my hands; the wood began to creak around the screws; I was almost there when I thought I heard someone sigh, bending over at the edge of the grave. ""If only I could get this off,"" I murmured, ""if only they would cover us both with earth!"" and I pulled with even more force. Another sigh sounded close to my ear."
"I appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.","I thought I felt her warm breath dispelling the icy wind. I knew there was no living creature nearby; but as surely as one senses the approach of a large body in the darkness, even if it's barely visible, I sensed Cathy's presence: not beneath me, but on the ground. Sudden relief swept through me."
"I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her there.","I gave up my pain and immediately turned around, comforted—unspeakably comforted. Her presence was with me: she stayed while I filled the grave and carried me home. You can laugh if you want, but I was sure I saw her there."
"I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance.","I was sure she was with me and couldn't resist talking to her. When I arrived at the Heights, I eagerly ran to the door. It was locked; and I still remember that damned Earnshaw and my wife resisting me."
"I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently - I felt her by me - I could ALMOST see her, and yet I COULD NOT! I ought to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning - from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton's.","I remember pausing to let him die, then running up the stairs to my room and hers. I looked around impatiently—I felt her beside me—I could almost have seen her, and yet I couldn't! I would have sweated with desire—with pleading for a single glance! I didn't get one. She proved, as so often in her life, to be a demon to me! And since then, sometimes more, sometimes less, I have been the target of this unbearable torture! Infernal! My nerves were so frayed that, had they not been like cat intestines, they would long ago have been as weak as Linton."
"When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I hastened to return; she MUST be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain! And when I slept in her chamber I was beaten out of that. I couldn't lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to see.","When I was in the house with Hareton, it seemed to me as if I were crossing it on my way out; when I crossed the moor, I met her on my way in. When I left the house, I came back hurriedly; she must be somewhere on the Downs, I was sure of it! And when I slept in her room, I was quite unconscious. I couldn't lie down; as soon as I closed my eyes, she was either out, opening the shutters, coming into the room, or laying her favorite head on the same pillow as when she was a child; and I had to open my eyes to see anything."
"And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night - to be always disappointed! It racked me! I've often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified - a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years!' Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.","And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night, only to be disappointed again and again! It tormented me! I often groaned aloud, until that old scoundrel Joseph doubtless thought my conscience was playing tricks on me. Now, since I've seen it, I'm somewhat calmer. It was a strange way of killing: not in small steps, but with fragments of hair, to entice me with the specter of a hope that had lasted eighteen years! Mr. Heathcliff stopped and mopped his brow; his hair was sticky there, damp with perspiration; his gaze was fixed on the red embers of the fire, his brows were not frowned but raised at the temples; which, while concealing the gloom of his face, gave it a strange expression of anxiety and the painful appearance of mental tension directed upon a single, all-absorbing theme."
"He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence. I didn't like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be saddled. 'Send that over to-morrow,' said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her, he added: 'You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own feet will serve you. Come along.' 'Good-bye, Ellen!' whispered my dear little mistress.","He spoke to me only half-heartedly, and I remained silent. I did not like listening to him! After a while, he returned his attention to the picture, took it down, and leaned it against the bench to examine it more closely. While he was thus absorbed, Catherine came in and announced that she would be ready as soon as her pony was saddled. ""Send it tomorrow,"" said Heathcliff; then, turning to her, he added, ""You can do without your pony: the weather is fine, and you will not need it at Wuthering Heights; no matter how far you go, your own feet will be enough. Come."" ""Goodbye, Ellen!"" whispered my dear little mistress."
"As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice. 'Come and see me, Ellen; don't forget.' 'Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!' said her new father. 'When I wish to speak to you I'll come here. I want none of your prying at my house!' He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.","When she kissed me, her lips were cold. ""Come and see, Ellen; don't forget that."" ""Don't, Mrs. Dean!"" said her new father. ""If I want to talk to you, I'll come. I don't want you to look at me!"" He gestured for her to go ahead; and with a look that touched me deeply, she obeyed. I watched them through the window as they crossed the garden."
"Heathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley, whose trees concealed them. I HAVE paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her, and wouldn't let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was 'thrang,' and the master was not in.","Heathcliff took Catherine's arm through his, despite her initial protests, and led her briskly into the driveway, where the trees concealed her. ""I visited the Heights, but I haven't seen her since she left."" Joseph held the door open for me with one hand when I asked and wouldn't let me through. He said Mrs. Linton was ""busy"" and the master wasn't there."
"Zillah has told me something of the way they go on, otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded, selfish woman.","Zillah explained to me how they operate; otherwise, I would hardly know who is dead and who is alive. She finds Catherine haughty and dislikes her, I can tell by the way she speaks. My young wife asked her for help immediately upon her arrival; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to mind her own business and let her daughter-in-law manage on her own; and Zillah, a narrow-minded and selfish woman, agreed without hesitation."
"Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me. 'The first thing Mrs. Linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the Heights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for? her cousin was very ill. '""We know that!"" answered Heathcliff; ""but his life is not worth a farthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him."" '""But I cannot tell how to do,"" she said; ""and if nobody will help me, he'll die!"" '""Walk out of the room,"" cried the master, ""and let me never hear a word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him."" 'Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton: Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her. 'How they managed together, I can't tell.","Catherine was childishly annoyed at this neglect; she paid the price with her contempt, and numbered my informant among her enemies as surely as if she had done her a grave wrong. About six weeks ago, shortly before your arrival, I had a long talk with Zillah at our meeting on the Moor, and this is what she told me: ""The first thing Mrs. Linton did,"" she told me, ""on arriving at the Heights, was to rush upstairs without even saying good night to Joseph and me; she locked herself in Linton's room and remained there until morning. Then, while Mr. and Earnshaw were breakfasting, she went into the house and, with trembling hands, asked everyone if it would be possible to send for the doctor. Her nephew was gravely ill. ""We know it!"" replied Heathcliff, ""but his life isn't worth a penny, and I won't spend a penny for him."" ""But I can't tell you how to do it,"" she said; ""And if no one helps me, he'll die!"" ""Get out of this room,"" cried the gentleman, ""and I never want to hear of him again! No one here cares what happens to him. If they do, play nurse. If not, lock him up and leave him alone."" ""Then she began to pester me, and I told her I was tired of this miserable situation. We both had our duties, and she should be waiting on Linton. Mr. Heathcliff said I left her to deal with it alone. How they managed it together, I cannot say."""
"I fancy he fretted a great deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice, after we had gone to bed, I've happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs'- top; and then I've shut myself in quick, for fear of being moved to interfere.","I think he was terribly angry and moaned day and night; and she hardly got any rest: you could see it in her pale face and heavy eyes. Sometimes she came into the kitchen, quite haggard, with her face as if she were begging for help; but I was obedient to the master: I would never dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and although I thought it wrong that Kenneth was not called, it was not my place to advise or complain, and I always refused to interfere. Once or twice after we had gone to bed, I happened to open the door again and saw her sitting at the top of the stairs, crying; so I quickly locked myself in the house, for fear of interfering."
"I did pity her then, I'm sure: still I didn't wish to lose my place, you know. 'At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me out of my wits, by saying, ""Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying - I'm sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him."" 'Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling.","I certainly felt sorry for her at the time, but I didn't want to lose my place. Finally, one night, she came into my room in a rage and frightened me by saying, 'Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying—this time I know. Get up at once and tell him.'"" After this speech, she disappeared again. I lay there for a quarter of an hour, listening and trembling."
"Nothing stirred - the house was quiet. 'She's mistaken, I said to myself. He's got over it. I needn't disturb them; and I began to doze.","Nothing moved; the house was silent. ""She's mistaken,"" I told myself. ""He's crossed the line. I don't need to disturb her,"" and I began to doze off."
"But my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell - the only bell we have, put up on purpose for Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated. 'I delivered Catherine's message. He cursed to himself, and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I followed.","But my sleep was disturbed a second time by a loud bell—the only one we have, hung especially for Linton. The master called me to see what was going on and to tell them he didn't want to hear that noise again. ""I've delivered Catherine's message."" He cursed himself and a few minutes later went into her room with a lit candle. I followed him."
"Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to Linton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to her. '""Now - Catherine,"" he said, ""how do you feel?"" 'She was dumb. '""How do you feel, Catherine?"" he repeated. '""He's safe, and I'm free,"" she answered: ""I should feel well - but,"" she continued, with a bitterness she couldn't conceal, ""you have left me so long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I feel like death!"" 'And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and heard our talk from outside, now entered.","Mrs. Heathcliff sat by the bed with clasped hands. Her father-in-law stepped forward, held the lamp before Linton's face, looked at it, and touched it; then he turned to her. ""Well, Catherine,"" he said, ""how do you feel?"" ""She was dumb."" ""How do you feel, Catherine?"" he repeated. ""He is safe, and I am free,"" she replied. ""I should be well, but,"" she continued with undisguised bitterness, ""you have left me to struggle with death alone for so long that I see and feel nothing but death! I feel like death!"" ""And she looked like it! I gave her wine."" Hareton and Joseph, who had been awakened by footsteps and had heard our conversation outside, came in."
"Joseph was fain, I believe, of the lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his help. He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself. 'In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at which I hardly wondered.","Joseph, I think, was glad the boy was gone; Hareton seemed worried, though he was more occupied in staring at Catherine than thinking about Linton. But the Lord bade him go back to bed: we didn't need his help. Later, he had Joseph carry the body into his room and told me to return to mine and leave Mrs. Heathcliff alone. The next morning, he sent me to tell her to come down to breakfast: she had undressed and seemed to be asleep, pretending to be ill; which didn't much surprise me."
"I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he replied, ""Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell me.""' Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled. Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton's will. He had bequeathed the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during her week's absence, when his uncle died.","I asked Mr. Heathcliff, and he said, ""Well, leave her alone until after the funeral. Go up now and then and get her what she needs. And as soon as she's better, let me know."" According to Zillah, Cathy stayed upstairs for two weeks; she visited him twice a day and would have been kinder, but her attempts to make her kinder were proudly and promptly rebuffed. Heathcliff once went up to show her Linton's will. He had left everything he owned and everything she had been to her father; the poor man was threatened or persuaded to do so during his week's absence after his uncle's death."
"The lands, being a minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wife's right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession. 'Nobody,' said Zillah, 'ever approached her door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.","He wasn't allowed to interfere with the lands belonging to the miners. Mr. Heathcliff, however, claimed them and kept them in his wife's and his own possession. I suppose that's legal; Catherine, who has neither money nor friends, certainly can't interfere with his property. ""No one,"" said Zillah, ""ever knocked at her door except that one time, except me; and no one asked for her. The first time she came into the house was on a Sunday afternoon."""
"She had cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker: she couldn't comb them out. 'Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:' the kirk, you know, has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists' or Baptists' place (I can't say which it is) at Gimmerton, a chapel. 'Joseph had gone,' she continued, 'but I thought proper to bide at home. Young folks are always the better for an elder's over-looking; and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn't a model of nice behaviour. I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.","She had cried out when I brought her supper upstairs that she could no longer bear the cold; I had told her the Lord was going to Thrushcross Grange and Earnshaw, and I needn't stop her from coming down. As soon as she heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she appeared, dressed in black, her blond curls tucked behind her ears as distinctly as a Quaker's; she couldn't comb them. ""Joseph and I usually go to chapel on Sundays,"" Mrs. Dean explained. ""The church, as you know, has no minister these days; and the Methodist or Baptist chapel (I forget which) in Gimmerton is called a chapel."" ""Joseph was away,"" she continued, ""but I thought it best to stay home. Young people always fare better in the care of an elder; and Hareton, despite his shyness, is no model of good manners. I informed him that his cousin would probably be coming along and that she still felt strongly about the observance of the Sabbath. Therefore, it was best if he left his weapons and other chores there."
"He coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes. The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.","He blushed at this news and glanced over his hands and clothes. The oil and gunpowder had disappeared in a flash. I saw that he wanted to keep her company; and from his demeanor, I concluded that he wanted to present himself well. Laughing—for I dare not laugh when the Lord is near—I offered him my help, if he wanted it, and mocked his distress."
"He grew sullen, and began to swear. 'Now, Mrs. Dean,' Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner, 'you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen you're right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now? She's as poor as you or I: poorer, I'll be bound: you're saying, and I'm doing my little all that road.' Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account. 'Missis walked in,' she said, 'as chill as an icicle, and as high as a princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.","He frowned and began to curse. ""Mrs. Dean,"" Zillah continued, seeing that I disliked her behavior, ""you may think your young wife too beautiful for Mr. Hareton; and you are right; but I confess I should like to temper her pride a little. And what is all her education and refinement worth to her now? She is as poor as you and I; poorer, I should say, and I always do my best."" Hareton allowed Zillah to help him; and she flattered him good-naturedly; and when Catherine arrived, half-forgetting her previous insults, he had tried, as the housekeeper reported, to make himself amiable. ""Miss came in,"" she said, ""cold as an icicle and as tall as a princess. I stood up and offered her my place in the armchair."""
"No, she turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved. '""I've been starved a month and more,"" she answered, resting on the word as scornful as she could. 'And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.","No, she rolled her eyes at my politeness. Earnshaw also stood up and ordered her to sit on the sofa by the fire: he was sure she was starving. ""I've been starving for a month or more,"" she replied, using the word with utter contempt. ""And she took a chair and placed it some distance away from the two of us. After sitting down until she was warm, she looked around and spotted some books on the dresser. She immediately jumped up and grabbed them, but they were too high."""
"Her cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that came to hand. 'That was a great advance for the lad. She didn't thank him; still, he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for something to read.","Her cousin, who had been watching her for some time, finally plucked up the courage to help her. She held his dress, and he filled it with the first object he found. ""That was a big step forward for the boy."" She didn't thank him; but he felt flattered that she had accepted his help and dared to stand behind her while she looked at the pictures. He even leaned forward to show her what she liked about some of the old pictures. Even the brutality with which she ripped the page from his fingers didn't discourage him: he simply stepped back a little and looked at her instead of reading the book. She continued reading or looked for something to read."
"His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn't see, and she couldn't see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a taking. '""Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping there?"" she cried, in a tone of disgust. ""I can't endure you! I'll go upstairs again, if you come near me."" 'Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me. 'Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I'm stalled of doing naught; and I do like - I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask of yourseln."" '""Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,"" I said, immediately. ""He'd take it very kind - he'd be much obliged."" 'She frowned; and looking up, answered '""Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of your faces, you all kept off.","His attention gradually became focused on the study of her thick, silky curls: he couldn't see her face, and she couldn't see him. And, perhaps not yet quite aware of what he was doing, but attracted like a child to a candle, he finally passed from looking to touching; he reached out and stroked her curls as gently as a bird's. He could have stung her neck; she shuddered. ""Go away now! How dare you touch me? Why are you standing there?"" she cried in disgust. ""I can't stand you! I'll come again if you come any closer."" Mr. Hareton backed away as stupidly as he could: he sat motionless on the sofa, and she leafed through her books for another half hour. Finally, Earnshaw came up to me and whispered: ""Will you ask him to read to us, Zillah? I'm all for idleness; and I like him—I'd like to hear him!"" I'm not saying I wanted to, but ask yourself. ""Mr. Hareton would like you to read to us, Madam,"" I said at once. ""He would find that very kind and greatly appreciate it."" She frowned, looked up, and replied, ""Mr. Hareton and all of you, be so kind as to understand that I reject any semblance of kindness you so hypocritically display! I despise you and have nothing to say to you! Although I would have given my life for a single kind word, if only to see one from you, you have all stayed away."""
"But I won't complain to you! I'm driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society."" '""What could I ha' done?"" began Earnshaw. ""How was I to blame?"" '""Oh! you are an exception,"" answered Mrs. Heathcliff. ""I never missed such a concern as you."" '""But I offered more than once, and asked,"" he said, kindling up at her pertness, ""I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you - "" '""Be silent! I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!"" said my lady. 'Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she'll curl back without respect of any one.","But I won't complain to you! It's the cold that brings me here, not to entertain you or enjoy your company. ""What could I have done?"" began Earnshaw. ""How can I be blamed?"" ""Oh! You are an exception,"" replied Mrs. Heathcliff. ""I have never been so lacking in solicitude as you."" ""But I have suggested and asked for it more than once,"" he said, provoking her boldness. ""I have asked Mr. Heathcliff to look after you—"" ""Hold your tongue! I would rather go out or anywhere than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!"" said my lady. ""Hareton whispered she would go to the devil for him!"" and he renounced his Sunday duties and threw away his gun. Then he spoke freely; and she soon thought it best to retire to her solitude; but the cold had set in, and in spite of her pride, she was compelled to degrade herself more and more in our company. However, I have taken care that my good nature is no longer despised. Since then, I have been as rigid as she is. She has neither a lover nor a lover among us, nor does she deserve one. For if the slightest word is spoken to her, she recoils without respect for anyone."
"She'll snap at the master himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.' At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me: but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange. Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story. Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another tenant to take the place after October.","She will attack the master himself and force him to strike her as often as he dares; and the more she is hurt, the more venomous she will become."" When I heard this story from Zillah, my first decision was to give up my position, take a cottage, and ask Catherine to live with me; but Mr. Heathcliff would accept her as well as Hareton in another house; and at present I see no solution unless she remarries; and that plan is not in my power. Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story. In spite of the doctor's predictions, I am recovering rapidly, and although it is only the second week of January, I intend to set out on horseback in a day or two and go to Wuthering Heights to inform my landlord that I shall be spending the next six months in London;"
"I would not pass another winter here for much. YESTERDAY was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request.","I wouldn't spend another winter here. Yesterday the sky was clear, calm, and icy. I went to the Heights as planned: My housekeeper asked me to deliver a message from her to her young wife, and I didn't refuse, for the worthy lady found nothing unusual in her request."
"The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.","The front door was open, but the enviable gate was locked, as it had been on my last visit. I knocked and called Earnshaw from the flowerbeds; he unchained the chain, and I entered. He is an attractive man, an irresistibly attractive farmer. This time I paid him special attention, but apparently he's doing his best to minimize his advantages."
"I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would be in at dinner-time. It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute for the host. We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first.","I asked if Mr. Heathcliff was at home. He replied, ""No, but he would be here around dinnertime."" It was eleven o'clock, and I announced that I would wait for him inside. He immediately put down his tools and accompanied me, as a watchdog, not as a deputy. We went in together; Catherine was there, making herself useful by preparing vegetables for the upcoming meal; she looked grumpier and less energetic than when I first met her."
"She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment. 'She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade me to believe. She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.' Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. 'Remove them yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton - but she asked aloud, 'What is that?' And chucked it off. 'A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own.","She hardly gave me a glance and applied herself to her work with the same contempt for everyday courtesies as before; she did not return my greeting or ""good morning"" with the slightest greeting. ""She does not look as friendly,"" I thought, ""as Mrs. Dean would have me believe. She is a beauty, but she is no angel."" Earnshaw harshly ordered her to fetch her things from the kitchen. ""She must fetch you herself,"" she said, pushing them away as soon as she had finished. Then she sank onto a stool by the window and began carving birds and animals out of the turnips that lay in her lap. I went over to her and pretended to glance into the garden. As it seemed to me, I deftly placed Mrs. Dean's letter on her lap without Hareton noticing. But she asked aloud, ""What is it?"" and threw it away. ""A letter from an old acquaintance, the housekeeper of the Grange,"" I answered. I was annoyed that she betrayed my kind gesture, and I was afraid that people would think it was a letter from me."
"She would gladly have gathered it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first. Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew out her pockethandkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy: 'I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be climbing up there! Oh! I'm tired - I'm STALLED, Hareton!' And she leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her. 'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, 'you are not aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it strange you won't come and speak to me.","She would have liked this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized it and put it in his waistcoat, remarking that Mr. Heathcliff must first examine it. Catherine then turned away from us in silence, furtively drew out her handkerchief, and placed it before her eyes; and her cousin, struggling for a moment with tender feelings, produced the letter and flung it on the ground beside her as spitefully as possible. Catherine took it and read it eagerly; then she asked me a few questions about the inhabitants of her old house, the sensible and the unreasonable; and, looking at the hills, she murmured in a monologue: ""I wish I could take Minny there! I wish I could climb them! Oh! I am tired, I am stuck, Hareton!"" And she leaned her beautiful head against the windowsill, half yawning, half sighing, and assumed an absent and sad attitude: she didn't care whether we were talking about her, or she knew it. ""Mrs. Heathcliff,"" I said, after sitting a while, ""don't you know that I'm an acquaintance of yours? So familiar that I find it strange that you don't speak to me."""
"My housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly disappointed if I return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter and said nothing!' She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked, 'Does Ellen like you?' 'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly. 'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear a leaf.' 'No books!' I exclaimed. 'How do you contrive to live here without them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a large library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and I should be desperate!' 'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.","My housekeeper never tires of talking about you and praising you. She will be very disappointed when I return and hear nothing from you except that you received her letter and have said nothing! She seemed surprised by this talk and asked, ""Does Ellen love you?"" ""Yes, very much,"" I answered hesitantly. ""You must tell her,"" she continued, ""that I would answer her letter, but I have nothing to write with: not even a book from which I could tear a page."" ""No books!"" I cried. ""How do you manage to live here without them? If I may ask so freely. Although I have a large library, I am often bored at the Grange. If you took my books away from me, I would despair!"" ""I always read when I had them,"" said Catherine. ""And Mr. Heathcliff never reads. That's why he's taken it into his head to destroy my books. I haven't seen them for weeks."""
"Only once, I searched through Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room - some Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here - and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall. Perhaps YOUR envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures? But I've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!' Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations. 'Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' I said, coming to his rescue. 'He is not ENVIOUS, but EMULOUS of your attainments.","Only once did I search Joseph's theological collection, much to his chagrin; and once, Hareton, I came across a secret hiding place in your room: Latin and Greek, histories and poems: such old friends. I brought the latter here, and you have gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the sheer love of stealing! They are of no use to you; or you have hidden them in the evil mind that, since you can derive no benefit from them, no one else can. Perhaps your envy drove Mr. Heathcliff to steal my treasures? But I have written most of them down in my head and engraved them on my heart, and you cannot take them away from me! Earnshaw blushed at this revelation of his private literary collections and stammered an indignant refutation of their accusations. ""Mr. Hareton is eager to expand his knowledge,"" I said to his relief. ""He does not envy you, but appreciates your achievements."""
"He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.' 'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine. 'Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you couldn't read their explanations!' The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I observed, - 'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.' 'Oh!' she replied, 'I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of deliberate malice.' Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.","In a few years, he'll be a brilliant student. ""And until then, he wants me to be an idiot,"" Catherine replied. ""Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read aloud, and he's making terrible mistakes! I wish you would imitate Chevy Chase like you did yesterday: it was awfully funny. I heard you; and I heard you looking up the difficult words in the dictionary and then cursing because you couldn't read the explanations!"" The young man was obviously annoyed at being laughed at for his ignorance and then ridiculed for trying to correct it. I had a similar idea, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote about her first attempt to shed light on the darkness in which he had been raised, and remarked, ""But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have all graduated and have all stumbled and staggered over the threshold before; if our teachers had scorned us instead of helping us, we would still be stumbling and staggering."" ""Oh!"" she replied, ""I do not wish to limit his knowledge, but he has no right to appropriate mine and ridicule me with his abominable errors and mispronunciations! These books, both in prose and poetry, were assigned to me by other societies, and I cannot bear to see them vilified and desecrated in his mouth! Moreover, as if out of conscious malice, he has chosen above all my favorite pieces, which I most like to repeat."" Hareton's chest rose and fell silently for a moment: he suffered from a violent feeling of humiliation and anger that he could not easily suppress."
"I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into Catherine's lap, exclaiming, - 'Take them! I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!' 'I won't have them now,' she answered. 'I shall connect them with you, and hate them.' She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it from her. 'And listen,' she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion. But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual cheek given to her saucy tongue.","I rose to politely dismiss him, sat down in the doorway, and contemplated the view. He followed my example and left the room, but soon returned with half a dozen books in his hand, which he flung into Catherine's lap, exclaiming: ""Take them! I never want to hear of them, read them, or think of them again!"" ""I don't want them now,"" she replied. ""I shall associate them with you, and hate them."" She opened one, which she had evidently turned over several times, and read aloud a passage in the drawling voice of a debutante; then she laughed and threw it away. ""And listen,"" she continued provocatively, beginning in the same tone a verse of an old ballad. But her self-esteem could bear no further torment: I heard, without absolute disapproval, a bold hand pass over her spiteful tongue."
"The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.","The little girl had done everything she could to hurt her niece's delicate, yet uncultured, feelings, and a physical confrontation was the only way to settle the score and take revenge on the perpetrator. Then he took the books and threw them into the fire. I could see in his face how painful this sacrifice was for the spleen."
"I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path. Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result. 'Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!' cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes. 'You'd BETTER hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely.","I imagined him, as we ate, recalling the pleasure they had already given him, the triumph and ever-increasing bliss he had expected; and I also fancied I could guess what drove him to his secret studies. He had been content with daily work and raw, animal pleasures until Catherine crossed his path. The shame of her contempt and the hope of her approval were his first impulses to higher aims; and instead of protecting him from the one and winning him to the other, his efforts to elevate himself had the exact opposite effect. ""Ay, that's all an animal like you can get!"" cried Catherine, sucking her injured lip and watching the burn with indignant eyes. ""You'd better keep quiet,"" he retorted sharply."
"And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and laying hold of his shoulder asked, - 'What's to do now, my lad?' 'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude. Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed. 'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was behind him. 'But when I look for his father in his face, I find HER every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to see him.' He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.","His excitement prevented him from continuing the conversation; he hurried to the entrance, where I let him pass. But before he had even passed through the door, Mr. Heathcliff came up the causeway, seized him by the shoulder, and asked, ""What now, my boy?"" ""Nothing, nothing,"" he said, and went away to indulge his grief and anger in solitude. Heathcliff watched him and sighed. ""It would be strange if I were to thwart myself,"" he murmured, not noticing that I was standing behind him. ""But when I look for her father in his face, I see her more and more every day! How can he be so like her? I can hardly bear to look at him."" He lowered his eyes and entered gloomily."
"There was a restless, anxious expression in his countenance. I had never remarked there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so that I remained alone. 'I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply to my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could readily supply your loss in this desolation.","His face was worried and troubled. I had never mentioned him before; and in person, he seemed much more frugal. His daughter-in-law saw him at the window and immediately ran into the kitchen. I was left alone. ""I'm glad to see you again, Mr. Lockwood,"" he said in response to my greeting. ""Partly for selfish reasons: I don't think I can easily compensate for your loss in this desolation."""
"I've wondered more than once what brought you here.' 'An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall not live there any more.' 'Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he said. 'But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from any one.' 'I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably irritated. 'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my note-book from my pocket. 'No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.","I have often wondered what brings you here. ""A caprice, I fear, sir,"" I replied; ""or a caprice will carry me away. I am going to London next week, and I must warn you that I do not intend to keep Thrushcross Grange longer than the twelve months I have agreed to rent it for. I do not think I shall live there much longer."" ""Oh, indeed; you are tired of being banished from the world, are you not?"" he said. ""But if you come to beg for a place you will not inhabit, your journey is useless: I will never be dissuaded from demanding my rights from anyone."" ""I came to beg for nothing,"" I cried, rather crossly. ""If you wish, I will come to an agreement with you now,"" and took my notebook from my pocket. ""No, no,"" he replied coldly; ""you will leave enough to pay your debts if you do not return."" I'm not in such a hurry."
"Sit down and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome. Catherine bring the things in: where are you?' Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks. 'You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff, aside, 'and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.' She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.","Sit down and dine with us; a guest who is unlikely to return is usually welcome. Catherine, bring in the provisions: where are you? Catherine appeared with a tray full of knives and forks. ""You can dine with Joseph,"" Heathcliff murmured off to the side, ""and stay in the kitchen until he leaves."" She followed his instructions to the letter: perhaps she would not be tempted to sin. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably couldn't appreciate anyone from a better social class if she met them."
"With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton, absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could not fulfil my wish. 'How dreary life gets over in that house!' I reflected, while riding down the road. 'What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!' 1802. - This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked, - 'Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.' 'Gimmerton?' I repeated - my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy. 'Ah! I know.","With the gloomy, gloomy Mr. Heathcliff on one side and the silent Hareton on the other, I prepared a rather gloomy supper and took my leave early. I had intended to leave by the back door to catch a last glimpse of Catherine and to tease old Joseph; but Hareton was instructed to lead my horse, and my host personally escorted me to the door, so my wish could not be fulfilled. ""How dull life is in this house!"" I thought, as I walked down the street. ""How romantic it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff if we had entered into a relationship as her kind nurse had desired, and settled down together in the lively atmosphere of the town!"" 1802. — Last September I was invited to roam the moors of a friend in the north, and on my way to his lodgings I unexpectedly found myself 15 miles from Gimmerton. The stable boy at an inn was holding a bucket of water to refresh my horses when a cart loaded with freshly harvested, very green oats passed by. He remarked, ""We're not from Gimmerton! They're only three shades behind the others with their harvest."" ""Gimmerton?"" I repeated. My stay in this area had already become vague and dreamy. ""Ah! I know."""
"How far is it from this?' 'Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered. A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn.","""How far is it from here?"" ""It's fourteen miles into the mountains, and the road is bad,"" he replied. I was suddenly overcome by a desire to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was barely midday, and I thought I might as well spend the night at home as at an inn."
"Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the distance in some three hours. I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.","Besides, I could easily take a day to settle my affairs with my landlord, thus saving myself the trouble of returning to the area. After a short rest, I asked my servant to inquire about the way to the village. Much to the exhaustion of our animals, we covered the distance in about three hours. I left him there and continued up the valley alone."
"The grey church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm weather - too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes.","The gray church looked even grayer, and the lonely cemetery even more so. I saw a Heidschnucke sheep grazing on the short grass of the graves. It was mild and warm—too hot to travel; but the heat didn't stop me from admiring the beautiful landscape from above and below. Had I seen it in August, I would surely have longed for a month of solitude."
"In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath. I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I rode into the court.","Nothing is darker in winter, nothing more heavenly in summer than these hill-fringed valleys and these rugged, wild moors. I arrived at the Grange before sunset and knocked for entry; but, judging by the thin blue wreath winding around the kitchen chimney, the family had retired to the back of the house and heard nothing. I went out into the courtyard."
"Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe. 'Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame. 'Mistress Dean? Nay!' she answered, 'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at th' Heights.' 'Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued. 'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied. 'Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.' 'T' maister!' she cried in astonishment. 'Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming? Yah sud ha' send word. They's nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t' place: nowt there isn't!' She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.","On the porch sat a little girl of nine or ten knitting, and an old woman lay on the steps, musing over her pipe. ""Is Mrs. Dean here?"" I asked the lady. ""Mrs. Dean? No!"" she answered, ""she doesn't live here, she's in the Heights."" ""Then you're the housekeeper?"" I continued. ""Well, keep the house clean,"" she replied. ""Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms I can stay in? I want to stay all night."" ""The master!"" she cried in surprise. ""Who knew you were coming? They must have sent a message. You can't find a dry or inexperienced person anywhere; there's nothing here!"" She threw away her pipe and hurried inside, the girl followed her, and I went in too. When I realized that her story was true and that I had almost upset her with my unwelcome appearance, I asked her to remain quiet."
"I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.","I went for a walk; in the meantime, she had to prepare a corner of the living room for me to eat in and a room to sleep in. No sweeping or dusting was necessary, just a warm fire and dry sheets. She seemed willing to do her best, but she threw the brush through the grate, mistaking it for the poker, and misused several other items from her work. But I withdrew, trusting that she would provide me with a place to rest upon my return."
"Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted the court. 'All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman. 'Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders. I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon in front - one fading, and the other brightening - as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.","Wuthering Heights was the destination of my outing. A memory brought me back there after I left the courthouse. ""Is everything all right at Wuthering Heights?"" I asked the woman. ""Is something going on there?"" she replied, hurrying off with a pan full of hot coals. I could have wondered why Mrs. Dean had left the Grange, but there was no way I could stop her in a situation like this. So I turned and strolled leisurely away, the glow of the setting sun behind me and the soft light of the rising moon before me—one fading, the other brightening—as I left the park and climbed the stony path that wound its way toward Mr. Heathcliff's estate."
"Before I arrived in sight of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock - it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought.","Before I could see it, the day was reduced to a faint amber glow in the west, but I could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass in the bright moonlight. I didn't have to climb or knock on the gate: it simply gave way. That's an improvement, I thought."
"And I noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit- trees. Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.","And something else caught my nose: a scent of violets and wallflowers hung in the air between the simple fruit trees. Doors and screens stood open; yet, as was usual in a mining region, a beautiful red fire lit the fireplace. The comfort it provided made the additional heat bearable. But the house in Stormwind is so large that its inhabitants have enough room to escape its influence; so they had positioned themselves not far from one of the windows."
"I could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered. 'Con-TRARY!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. 'That for the third time, you dunce! I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or I'll pull your hair!' 'Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now, kiss me, for minding so well.' 'No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.' The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention.","I saw and heard them talking even before I entered, so I watched and listened, driven by a mixture of curiosity and envy that grew the longer I lingered. ""On the contrary!"" said a voice, soft as a silver bell. ""That's the third time, you idiot! I won't tell you again. Remember it, or I'll tear your hair out!"" ""On the contrary,"" replied another in a deep but gentle voice. ""And now kiss me for your attention."" ""No, first read it carefully, without making a single mistake."" The speaker began to read: It was a young man, appropriately dressed, sitting at a table, a book in front of her. Her beautiful face beamed with joy, and her gaze wandered impatiently from the page to a small white hand on her shoulder, which reminded her with a sharp slap on the cheek whenever the owner noticed such signs of inattention."
"Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend his studies; and her face - it was lucky he could not see her face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty. The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he generously returned.","The landlady stood behind him; her light, glossy curls mingled now and then with her brown eyes as she bent down to help him study; and her face—fortunately, he couldn't see it, or he would never have been so consistent. I could; and I bit my lip, unable to do anything but stare at her enchanting beauty. The task was completed, not without further mistakes; but the apprentice demanded a reward and received at least five kisses, which he generously returned."
"Then they came to the door, and from their conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents. 'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!' said the tenant of the kitchen, in answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's. 'It's a blazing shame, that I cannot oppen t' blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and all t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld! Oh! ye're a raight nowt; and shoo's another; and that poor lad 'll be lost atween ye.","Then they came to the door, and their conversation revealed to me that they were taking a walk on the moor. I suspected that if I showed myself unhappy in his presence, not in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, but in his mouth, I would be condemned to the depths of hell. Feeling very wicked and malicious, I sought shelter in the kitchen. There, too, access was free. By the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song. This was often interrupted from within by harsh words of contempt and intolerance, spoken in unmusical accents. ""I would rather have had her cursing in my arms all morning to hear you than listen to you!"" said the kitchen maid, in answer to an inaudible rejoinder from Nelly. ""It is a terrible shame that I cannot open the Holy Book, but that you have dedicated that glory to Satan and all the vile wickedness that ever saw the light of day! Oh! You are a good man; and another one too; and this poor fellow will be lost among you."
"Poor lad!' he added, with a groan; 'he's witched: I'm sartin on't. Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer rullers!' 'No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the singer. 'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and never mind me. This is ""Fairy Annie's Wedding"" - a bonny tune - it goes to a dance.' Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me directly, she jumped to her feet, crying - 'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood! How could you think of returning in this way? All's shut up at Thrushcross Grange.","""Poor fellow!"" he added, groaning. ""He's bewitched. I'm not making this up. Lord, judge them, for there is no law and justice of the North under our rulers!"" ""No! Otherwise we'd be in the fog, I think,"" replied the singer. ""But make a wish, old fellow, read your Bible like a Christian and pay me no attention. It's 'Fairy Annie's Wedding'—a lovely tune—we'll dance."" Mrs. Dean was about to continue when I appeared. She recognized me at once, jumped up, and cried, ""What, sir, Mr. Lockwood! How can you come back like this? Everything's closed at Thrushcross Grange."""
"You should have given us notice!' 'I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,' I answered. 'I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.' 'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?' 'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and while they make me lodging room there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of having another opportunity in a hurry.' 'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 'He's gone out at present, and won't return soon.' 'About the rent,' I answered. 'Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 'or rather with me.","You should have warned us! ""I have arranged lodgings for my stay there,"" I replied. ""I am leaving tomorrow. And how did you get here, Mrs. Dean? Tell me."" ""Zillah is gone, and Mr. Heathcliff wanted me to come to London soon after your departure and stay until you returned. But please, come in! Did you walk from Gimmerton this evening?"" ""From the manor,"" I replied, ""and while they are taking care of my lodgings, I wish to settle my affairs with your master; for I do not think I shall have an opportunity of doing so again any time soon."" ""What affairs, sir?"" asked Nelly, ushering me in. ""He is away at the moment and will not be back soon."" ""About the rent,"" I replied. ""Oh! Then you must settle that with Mrs. Heathcliff,"" she remarked, ""or rather, with me."""
"She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her: there's nobody else.' I looked surprised. 'Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued. 'Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished. 'How long ago?' 'Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?' 'I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too.","She hasn't yet learned to manage her own affairs, and I'm taking her place: there's no one else. I seemed surprised. ""Ah! You haven't heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,"" she continued. ""Heathcliff is dead!"" I cried, surprised. ""How long ago was that?"" ""Three months ago: but sit down, let me take your hat, and I'll tell you all about it. Hold, you haven't eaten anything yet, have you?"" ""I don't want anything: I've ordered dinner home. Sit down, too."""
"I never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you don't expect them back for some time - the young people?' 'No - I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they don't care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you good: you seem weary.' She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking whether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar! He fair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.' She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.","I never dreamed of her death! Tell me what it was like. You say you're not expecting the young people soon? ""No, I have to scold them every night for wandering around late, but they don't like me. At least drink a glass of our old beer; it will do you good, you look tired."" She hurried off to get it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph ask if it was ""a pity that at her age she already had pupils? And then to fetch the children from the master's cellar!"" He was ashamed to ""wait a little longer."" She didn't stop for revenge, but returned a moment later with a sparkling silver pint, the contents of which I praised with due seriousness."
"And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history. He had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it. I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake.","And then she told me the rest of Heathcliff's story. It had, as she called it, a ""strange"" ending. ""Two weeks after your departure, I was summoned to Wuthering Heights,"" she told me; and I gladly obeyed, for Catherine's sake."
"My first interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day.","My first conversation with her was sad and dismaying: she had changed so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff didn't explain to me why he had changed his mind about my coming; he simply said he wanted me and was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the living room my living room and keep her with me. It was enough for him to see her once or twice a day."
"She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and restless.","She seemed content with this arrangement; and little by little, I smuggled in a large number of the books and articles that had kept her entertained at the Grange, flattering myself that we would survive the time reasonably comfortably. This illusion, however, did not last long. Catherine, initially content, soon became irritable and restless."
"For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him - and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible - after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived - how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and dozing. 'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!' Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look again. 'He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued. 'He twitched his shoulder as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.' 'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't behave!' I said.","First, she wasn't allowed to leave the garden, and it annoyed her immensely to be locked up there in the spring; second, I often had to leave her alone while I looked after the house, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarreling with Joseph in the kitchen to being quietly alone. Her skirmishes didn't bother me, but Hareton often had to go into the kitchen too when the master wanted the house to himself! And although at first she would quietly leave the kitchen in his presence, or discreetly interfere in my activities, avoid remarks, or talk to him—and although he was always as sullen and taciturn as possible—after a while she changed her behavior and could no longer leave him alone: she talked to him; noticed his stupidity and laziness; marveled that he could maintain this way of life, that he could spend an entire evening staring into the fire and dozing. ""He's like a dog, isn't he, Ellen?"" ""Or a cart-horse?"" He works, eats, and sleeps forever! What an empty, sullen mind he must have! Do you dream sometimes, Hareton? And if so, about what? But you can't talk to me!' Then she looked at him; but he neither opened his mouth nor looked at her again. 'Perhaps he's dreaming now,' she continued. 'He pulled her by the shoulder while Juno pulled him. Ask him, Ellen.' 'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to let you ride if you don't behave!' I said."
"He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted to use it. 'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she exclaimed, on another occasion. 'He is afraid I shall laugh at him. Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and, because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a fool?' 'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.' 'Perhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did not expect him to be so silly. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll try!' She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck. 'Well, I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table-drawer; and I'm going to bed.' Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.","Not only did he have a bent shoulder, but his fist was also clenched, as if he were tempted to use it. ""I know why Hareton never says anything when I'm in the kitchen,"" she exclaimed another time. ""He's afraid I'll make fun of him. Ellen, what do you think? One day he started teaching himself to read; and when I laughed, he burned his books and dropped them. Wasn't he stupid?"" ""You weren't naughty?"" I asked. ""Give me this."" ""Perhaps,"" she continued, ""but I didn't think he was so stupid. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll try!"" She placed one in his hand, which she read attentively; he threw it away, muttering that he would break her neck if she didn't give it up. ""Well, I'll put it in the table drawer here,"" she said, ""and then I'll go to bed."" Then she whispered to me to be careful when he touched it and left."
"But he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.","But he didn't want to think about it, so I told him the next morning, much to his disappointment. I noticed that she regretted her persistent bad mood and laziness: her conscience reproached her for preventing him from improving, which she had indeed done. But her ingenuity helped repair the damage: While I was ironing or doing other mundane chores that I couldn't properly do in the salon, she would bring me a good book and read to me."
"When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was useless. Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment.","When Hareton was there, she would usually stop at an interesting text and leave the book lying there. She did this often. But he was as stubborn as a mule, and instead of grabbing her in bad weather, he took to smoking with Joseph. They sat like automatons on either side of the fireplace. The elder, fortunately, was too deaf to understand her sordid nonsense, as he would have called it, while the younger did his best to pretend he knew nothing about it. On fine evenings, the latter would follow his shots, and Catherine would yawn and sigh, teasing me to speak to her, and running into the yard or garden as soon as I started. And as a last resort, she would cry and say she was tired of living: her life was worthless. Mr. Heathcliff, who liked company less and less, had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment."
"Owing to an accident at the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again.","At the beginning of March, an accident forced him to spend several days in the kitchen. His rifle exploded while he was alone in the mountains; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a lot of blood before he could return home. He was therefore forced to stay by the fire and rest until he regained his strength."
"It suited Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might accompany me. On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.","Catherine was pleased with his presence; well, she hated it more than ever, and made me do some things downstairs so she could accompany me. On Easter Monday, Joseph took cattle to Gimmerton Fair; and in the afternoon I was busy hanging up the washing in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat gloomily by the fire, as usual, and my little mistress amused herself for an hour by painting at the windows, alternating her conversation with suppressed singing, whispered exclamations, and quick, irritated, and impatient glances at her cousin, who smoked incessantly and stared at the grate."
"At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin - 'I've found out, Hareton, that I want - that I'm glad - that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.' Hareton returned no answer. 'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued. 'Get off wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness. 'Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth. Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the fire.","When I realized I could no longer bear her blocking my light, she went to the fireplace. I paid little attention to her antics, but suddenly heard her begin: ""I have found, Hareton, that I wish—and am glad—I had you for a cousin now, if you had not been so angry and brutal to me."" Hareton did not reply. ""Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! Do you hear me?"" she continued. ""Go away!"" he growled relentlessly. ""Let me get the pipe,"" she said, gently snatching it from his mouth. Before he could take it, it had broken and lay behind the fire."
"He swore at her and seized another. 'Stop,' she cried, 'you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while those clouds are floating in my face.' 'Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed, ferociously, 'and let me be!' 'No,' she persisted, 'I won't: I can't tell what to do to make you talk to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you stupid, I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you. Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.' 'I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned mocking tricks!' he answered. 'I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I look sideways after you again.","He scolded her and took another. ""Stop,"" she cried, ""you must listen to me first; and I cannot speak while these clouds hover over my face."" ""Go to hell!"" he cried desperately, ""and leave me alone!"" ""No,"" she insisted, ""I will not. I don't know how to make you talk, and I'm sure you won't understand. When I call you an idiot, I don't do it out of mere contempt: I don't mean that I despise you. Come, listen to me, Hareton. You are my cousin, and you will know me."" ""I will have nothing more to do with you, with your filthy pride and your damned sneers!"" he replied. ""I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I look askance at you again."""
"Side out o' t' gate, now, this minute!' Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency to sob. 'You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,' I interrupted, 'since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.' 'A companion!' he cried; 'when she hates me, and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for seeking her good-will any more.' 'It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, no longer disguising her trouble. 'You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and more.' 'You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw: 'why have I made him angry, by taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and despised me, and - Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you worried me out of the kitchen!' 'I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 'and I was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you to forgive me: what can I do besides?' She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground.","""Out of the gate, at once!"" Catherine frowned and retreated to the windowsill, biting her lip and trying to conceal her growing tendency to sob by humming an eccentric tune. ""You should make friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,"" I interrupted, ""as she repents of her insolence. It would do you a great deal of good; you would become a different person to have her for company."" ""Company!"" he cried; ""while she hates me and does not think me worthy to wash her! No, if that made me a king, I should no longer be despised for seeking her favor."" ""It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!"" sobbed Cathy, unable to hide her grief. ""You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff, and more."" ""You're a damned liar,"" Earnshaw began, ""so why did I make him angry by taking your side a hundred times? And all this while you laughed at me and despised me and... Go on with me, and I'll come in and say you drove me out of the kitchen!"" ""I didn't know you were on my side,"" she answered, wiping her eyes, ""and I was miserable and bitter about everyone; but now I thank you and beg your pardon: what else can I do?"" She went back to the hearth and openly held out her hand to him. His face darkened, and he frowned like a thunderstorm, his fists tightly clenched, his eyes fixed on the ground."
"Catherine, by instinct, must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered - 'Well! what should I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that I like him - that I want to be friends.' Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful, for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.","Catherine must have instinctively suspected that it was not dislike but stubborn obstinacy that motivated this obstinacy; for after a moment's hesitation, she leaned forward and pressed a tender kiss on his cheek. The little beast, thinking I hadn't seen her, drew back and very demurely resumed her usual place by the window. I shook my head disapprovingly, and then she blushed and murmured, ""Well, what could I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake my hand or look at me: I had to show him that I liked him, that I wanted to be his friend."" I don't know whether the kiss convinced Hareton: for several minutes he was very careful not to show his face, and when he raised it, he had absolutely no idea where to direct his gaze."
"Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to 'Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,' she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined recipient. 'And tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it right,' she said; 'and, if he refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and never tease him again.' I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee. He did not strike it off, either.","Catherine was busy carefully wrapping a beautiful book in white paper, securing it with a ribbon, and addressing it to ""Mr. Hareton Earnshaw."" She asked me to be her ambassador and deliver the gift to the recipient. ""And tell him, if he accepts it, I'll come and show him how to read it properly,"" she said. ""And if he refuses, I'll come upstairs and never bother him again."" I carried the book and repeated the message under the worried gaze of my employer. Hareton refused to open his fingers, so I placed it on his lap. He didn't cross it out either."
"I returned to my work. Catherine leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured petition. 'Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.","I turned back to my work. Catherine rested her head and arms on the table until she heard the soft rustle of the bedspread being thrown back; then she stepped back and sat quietly beside her cousin. He was trembling, his face glowing; all his coarseness and sullen hardness had left him. At first, he couldn't summon the courage to utter a single syllable in response to her questioning look and murmured plea. ""Tell me you forgive me, Hareton, do."""
"You can make me so happy by speaking that little word.' He muttered something inaudible. 'And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine, interrogatively. 'Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered; 'and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.' 'So you won't be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and creeping close up. I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies. The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.","""You can make me so happy with that little word."" He muttered something unintelligible. ""And you'll be my friend?"" Catherine added questioningly. ""No, you'll be ashamed of me all your life,"" he replied; ""and the more ashamed you are, the better you know me; and I can't bear that."" ""Then you won't be my friend?"" she said with a honey-sweet smile, approaching. I heard no more intelligible conversation, but when I turned around, I saw two faces so radiant, bent over the page of the accepted book, that I had no doubt that the treaty had been ratified by both sides and that the enemies were now sworn allies. The work they were studying was full of valuable paintings; and these, along with their position, had enough charm to leave them cold until Joseph's return."
"He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder; and confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity: it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat. 'Tak' these in to t' maister, lad,' he said, 'and bide there.","He, poor man, was astonished to see Catherine sitting on the same bench as Hareton Earnshaw, her hand on his shoulder; and amazed at his favorite's patience in enduring her presence: it affected him too deeply to make any comment on it that evening. His emotion was revealed only in the deep sighs he heaved as he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table and covered it with dirty banknotes from his pocketbook, the proceeds of the day's dealings. Finally, he called Hareton from his seat. ""Take this to the Lord, my boy,"" he said, ""and stay there."""
"I's gang up to my own rahm. This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we mun side out and seearch another.' 'Come, Catherine,' I said, 'we must ""side out"" too: I've done my ironing. Are you ready to go?' 'It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly. 'Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring some more to-morrow.' 'Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak' into th' hahse,' said Joseph, 'and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!' Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as she passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, I venture to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to Linton.","I'm going home. This house is neither manly nor fitting for us: we must go out and find another. ""Come, Catherine,"" I said, ""we must go out too: I've been there again. Are you ready to go?"" ""It's not eight o'clock yet!"" she answered, rising reluctantly. ""Hareton, I'll leave this book on the mantelpiece and bring another tomorrow."" ""Any books you leave I'll take home,"" said Joseph, ""and if you find them somewhere else, that's a bonus; then you'll consider yourself lucky!"" Cathy threatened to make her library pay for hers; and smiling as she passed Hareton, she went upstairs singing: lighter at heart, I dare say, than she had ever felt under that roof; except perhaps on her first visits to Linton."
"The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same point - one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed - they contrived in the end to reach it. You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart.","The intimacy thus established grew rapidly, but was occasionally interrupted. Earnshaw was not very desirable, and my young wife was neither a philosopher nor a model of patience; but since they both pursued the same goal—one loved and desired appreciation, the other loved and desired to be appreciated—they eventually achieved it. You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was quite easy to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart."
"But now, I'm glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there won't be a happier woman than myself in England! ON the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore.","But now I'm glad you didn't try. The crowning of all my hopes will be the union of these two. I will envy no one on their wedding day: there will be no happier woman in England than me! The day after that Monday, when Earnshaw was still unable to go to his usual work and therefore stayed at home, I soon realized that it would be impossible to keep my nurse by my side as before."
"She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the Grange. I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them. 'There! That will be all shown to the master,' I exclaimed, 'the minute it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head of it: see if we don't! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!' 'I'd forgotten they were Joseph's,' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled; 'but I'll tell him I did it.' We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.","She led me downstairs into the garden, where she had observed her cousin performing menial tasks. When I invited her to lunch, I saw that she had persuaded him to clear a large patch of gooseberry and currant bushes, and that they were in the process of importing seedlings from the manor. I was appalled at the mischief that had been caused within half an hour; the currant bushes were Joseph's favorite, and she had just selected a group of them. ""Now! All this will be shown to the master,"" I cried, ""as soon as it is discovered. And what excuse have you to me for these liberties in the garden? We shall be amused; we shall see! Mr. Hareton, I wonder if you have not enough sense to go at his bidding and make such a mess!"" ""I forgot they belonged to Joseph,"" replied Earnshaw, somewhat surprised. ""But I will tell him I did it."" We always dined with Mr. Heathcliff."
"I held the mistress's post in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility. 'Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,' were my whispered instructions as we entered the room. 'It will certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he'll be mad at you both.' 'I'm not going to,' she answered. The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge.","I did the housework: making tea and cutting; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine usually sat next to me, but that day she moved closer to Hareton; and I soon realized that she was as reserved in her friendship as she was in her hostility. ""Be careful not to talk too much to your cousin or pay too much attention to him,"" I whispered to her as I entered the room. ""That would certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he would be angry with both of you."" ""I won't,"" she replied. A minute later, she had walked over to him and was putting primroses into his bowl of porridge."
"He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh. I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh.","He dared not speak to her; he hardly dared to look at her; and yet she continued to tease him until twice he almost burst out laughing. I frowned, and then she looked at the gentleman, whose thoughts, as his face betrayed, were elsewhere than his company; and for a moment she became serious again and regarded him with profound seriousness. Then she turned away and resumed her chatter; finally, Hareton gave a stifled laugh."
"Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred. 'It is well you are out of my reach,' he exclaimed. 'What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes? Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence again. I thought I had cured you of laughing.' 'It was me,' muttered Hareton. 'What do you say?' demanded the master. Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.","Mr. Heathcliff flinched; his gaze flickered over our faces. Catherine returned his usual nervous, provocative glare, which he detested. ""Luckily you're out of reach,"" he cried. ""What the devil has possessed you to stare at me with those devilish eyes all the time? Go away! And never remind me of your existence again. I thought I'd cured you of laughter."" ""I have,"" murmured Hareton. ""What do you say to that?"" asked the gentleman. Hareton looked down at his plate and didn't repeat his confession."
"Mr. Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door, revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began:- 'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa! I HED aimed to dee wheare I'd sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I'd lug my books up into t' garret, and all my bits o' stuff, and they sud hev' t' kitchen to theirseln; for t' sake o' quietness.","Mr. Heathcliff looked at him for a moment, then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted reflections. We were almost finished, and the two young men crept cautiously away. I had therefore not expected to be further disturbed during the meeting when Joseph appeared in the doorway and, with a quivering lip and an angry look, revealed that the atrocities against his precious shrubberies had been noticed. He must have seen Cathy and her cousin before investigating, because despite his chattering jaw and his slurred speech, he began: ""I need my wages, and then I must be off! I had intended to go to where I had saved for sixty years; and I thought I would put my books and all my things up in the attic, and then they would take over the kitchen for peace and quiet."""
"It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I thowt I COULD do that! But nah, shoo's taan my garden fro' me, and by th' heart, maister, I cannot stand it! Yah may bend to th' yoak an ye will - I noan used to 't, and an old man doesn't sooin get used to new barthens. I'd rayther arn my bite an' my sup wi' a hammer in th' road!' 'Now, now, idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'cut it short! What's your grievance? I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.' 'It's noan Nelly!' answered Joseph. 'I sudn't shift for Nelly - nasty ill nowt as shoo is.","It was hard leaving my old home, but I thought I could! But no, my garden is mine, and by God, Lord, I can't bear it! Make yourself comfortable—I never have before, and an old man doesn't get used to new houses so quickly. I'd rather throw my food and croquettes out into the street!' 'Come on, you idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'be brief! What's wrong with you? I don't interfere in your quarrels with Nelly. She can throw you into the pit for any reason.' 'It isn't Nelly!' retorted Joseph. 'I'm not moving for Nelly—it's not dirty.'"
"Thank God! SHOO cannot stale t' sowl o' nob'dy! Shoo wer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her 'bout winking. It's yon flaysome, graceless quean, that's witched our lad, wi' her bold een and her forrard ways - till - Nay! it fair brusts my heart! He's forgotten all I've done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a whole row o' t' grandest currant-trees i' t' garden!' and here he lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition. 'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff. 'Hareton, is it you he's finding fault with?' 'I've pulled up two or three bushes,' replied the young man; 'but I'm going to set 'em again.' 'And why have you pulled them up?' said the master. Catherine wisely put in her tongue. 'We wanted to plant some flowers there,' she cried. 'I'm the only person to blame, for I wished him to do it.' 'And who the devil gave YOU leave to touch a stick about the place?' demanded her father-in-law, much surprised. 'And who ordered YOU to obey her?' he added, turning to Hareton.","Thank goodness! Shoo cannot make the nobleman's soul turn pale! Shoo was so beautiful, but what a body when she winks! It was that sweet, graceful lady who charmed our boy with her pert face and her prejudices—until—No! It really pains me! He has forgotten all I have done for him, and all I have done to him, and he is cutting down a whole row of the biggest gooseberry bushes in the garden!' And here he was complaining openly, insensible to his bitter injuries, about Earnshaw's ingratitude and the dangerous situation. 'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff. 'Hareton, is he criticizing you?' 'I have pulled up two or three bushes,' answered the young man, 'but I will replant them.' 'And why did you pull them up?' asked the gentleman. Catherine wisely stuck out her tongue. 'They wanted to plant flowers over there,' she cried. 'I'm the only one responsible for that, because I was the one who wanted them to do it.' 'And who in God's name gave you permission to touch a stick over there?' her father-in-law asked, very surprised. 'And who ordered you to obey him?' he added, turning to Hareton."
"The latter was speechless; his cousin replied - 'You shouldn't grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!' 'Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,' said Heathcliff. 'And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast. 'Silence!' he exclaimed. 'Get done, and begone!' 'And Hareton's land, and his money,' pursued the reckless thing. 'Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!' The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate. 'If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,' she said; 'so you may as well sit down.' 'If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him to hell,' thundered Heathcliff. 'Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen! I'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!' Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go. 'Drag her away!' he cried, savagely. 'Are you staying to talk?' And he approached to execute his own command. 'He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more,' said Catherine; 'and he'll soon detest you as much as I do.' 'Wisht! wisht!' muttered the young man, reproachfully; 'I will not hear you speak so to him. Have done.' 'But you won't let him strike me?' she cried. 'Come, then,' he whispered earnestly. It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her. 'Now, YOU go!' he said to Earnshaw. 'Accursed witch! this time she has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her repent it for ever!' He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her looks, entreating him not to hurt her that once.","He stood speechless; his cousin retorted: ""You shouldn't deny me a few yards of land to decorate when you've taken all my land!"" ""Your land, you insolent little thing! You never had anything,"" said Heathcliff. ""And my money,"" she continued; she met his gaze and bit into a piece of crust, the remainder of her breakfast. ""Hush!"" he cried. ""Get out of here and go!"" ""And Hareton's land and his money,"" continued the imprudent man. ""Hareton and I are friends now; and I'll tell him all about you!"" The gentleman seemed stunned for a moment; he turned pale and stood up, looking at her all the time with an expression of deadly hatred. ""If you hit me, Hareton will hit you,"" she said; ""so you'd better sit down."" ""If Hareton doesn't get you out, I'll beat the hell out of him,"" thundered Heathcliff. ""Damned witch! Do you dare set him against me? Let her go! Do you hear? Throw her into the kitchen! I'll finish her, Ellen Dean, if you let her appear before me again!"" Hareton tried to calm her in a low voice. ""Take her away!"" he cried desperately. ""Will you stay and talk?"" And he stepped forward to carry out his own command. ""He will disobey you, wicked man,"" said Catherine; ""and soon he will hate you as much as I do."" ""Wish for it! Wish for it!"" murmured the young man reproachfully; ""I won't let you talk to him like that. That's all."" ""But you won't let him hit me, will you?"" she cried. ""Go on,"" he murmured gravely. It was too late: Heathcliff had seized her. ""Go on!"" he said to Earnshaw. ""Damned witch!"" This time she provoked me when I could bear it no longer; And I'll make her regret it forever! Her hand was in her hair; Hareton tried to avert his gaze, begging him not to hurt her this time."
"Heathcliff's black eyes flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine, said, with assumed calmness - 'You must learn to avoid putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I'll send him seeking his bread where he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.","Heathcliff's black eyes flashed; he seemed to be tearing Catherine to pieces, and the thought of risking her rescue was just exciting me when his fingers suddenly loosened; he shifted his grip from her head to her arm and looked at her intently. Then, covering his eyes with one hand, he stood a moment to compose himself, turned back to Catherine, and said, seemingly calmly: ""You must learn not to provoke me, or I'll kill you one day! Go with Mrs. Dean and stay with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. And as for Hareton Earnshaw: if I see him listening to you, I'll send him to fetch his bread wherever he can find it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar."""
"Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!' I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. I had counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, as soon as he perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not return before evening.","Nelly, take her away! And leave me all alone! Leave me alone! I led my young wife out; she was too happy with her escape to resist; the other followed her, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself until dinner. I had advised Catherine to dine upstairs, but as soon as he saw her place vacant, he sent for her. He didn't speak a word to us, ate very little, and left immediately, pretending he would not return until evening."
"The two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence; where I heard Hareton sternly cheek his cousin, on her offering a revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father. He said he wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the devil, it didn't signify; he would stand by him; and he'd rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like HIM to speak ill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break - chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen.","The two new friends settled down in the house during his absence, where I heard Hareton severely rebuke his niece when she made a revelation to him about her stepfather's conduct. He said he would not tolerate a word of contempt: if he were the devil, it would mean nothing; he would support him; and he would rather she abuse herself as she used to, than speak ill of Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was furious at this; but he found a way to silence her by asking her how she would feel if he spoke ill of her father. She then understood that Earnshaw was usurping the Lord's reputation, and that he was in fetters stronger than reason could break—chains forged by habit, and which it would be cruel to break."
"She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don't believe she has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter's hearing, against her oppressor since. When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on.","From then on, she showed good cheer by avoiding complaints and expressions of dislike toward Heathcliff. She confessed to me her sorrow at having stirred up tensions between him and Hareton. Indeed, I don't believe she ever uttered a word against her oppressor in his presence since then. This little quarrel settled, they were friends again and as busy as possible with their various duties as pupil and teacher. I sat with them after finishing my work and felt so soothed and comforted by the sight of them that I didn't notice how quickly the time passed."
"You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and Catherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags.","They both looked, in some ways, like my children: I had long been proud of one, and now I was sure the other would give me just as much joy. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature quickly dispelled the clouds of ignorance and humiliation in which he had grown up; and Catherine's sincere praise spurred his zeal. Her cheerfulness lit up his face and gave him enthusiasm and generosity: I could hardly imagine that this was the same person I had seen the day I rediscovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights after her expedition to the Crags."
"While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them.","While I admired them and they gave their best, dusk fell, and with it the professor. He met us unexpectedly as we entered through the front door and saw all three of us before we could even raise our heads to look at him. Well, I thought, there had never been a more pleasant and innocent sight; and it would be a shame to blame them."
"The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity. They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.","The red glow of the fire illuminated their two beautiful heads and revealed their faces, filled with the excitement of childlike enthusiasm. For although he was twenty-three and she eighteen, both had so much to experience and learn that they neither felt nor displayed the emotions of a sober and disillusioned adult. They looked up together at Mr. Heathcliff: they may never have noticed that their eyes are identical and that they belong to Catherine Earnshaw. The Catherine of today resembles him in nothing, except in her broad forehead and the flared nostrils, which, whether she wants it or not, give her a somewhat haughty appearance."
"With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times, THEN it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still. 'It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded awhile on the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me.","At Hareton, the resemblance went even further: it is always remarkable, but it was especially striking, for his senses were sharpened and his mental faculties aroused to unusual activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he went to the fireplace, visibly agitated; but his agitation soon vanished when he looked at the young man; or rather, its manner changed, for it was still there. He took the book from her hand, glanced at the open page, and then returned it to her without a word; he merely beckoned to Catherine. Her companion remained standing behind her for a moment, and I was about to start, but he ordered me to remain silent. ""This is a poor termination, is it not?"" he remarked, after reflecting for a moment on the scene he had just witnessed. ""An absurd termination to my violent exertions? I will take levers and pickaxes to demolish the two houses and practice working like Hercules."" And when everything is ready and within my power, I realize that the desire to lift a slate from the roof has vanished! My old enemies have not defeated me; the time has come to take revenge on their representatives: I could do it, and no one could stop me."
"But where is the use? I don't care for striking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing. 'Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly remember to eat and drink.","But why? I don't like hitting: I don't want to raise my hand! It seems as if all this time I've been making an effort to show generosity. This is far from the case: I've lost the ability to appreciate its destruction and am too lazy to destroy for nothing. ""Nelly, a strange change is about to happen; I'm standing in its shadow right now. I'm so uninterested in my daily life that I hardly think about food or drink anymore."""
"Those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About HER I won't speak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. HE moves me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never see him again! You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,' he added, making an effort to smile, 'if I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.","These two people who have left the room are the only objects that still have a distinct material appearance for me; and this appearance pains me, almost frightens me. I don't want to speak of her; and I don't want to think of her; but I ardently wish she were invisible; her presence only arouses mad feelings in me. He has a different effect on me: and yet, if I could, without appearing mad, I would never see him again! ""You might think,"" he added, trying to smile, ""I am more inclined to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas that he evokes or embodies."""
"But you'll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another. 'Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every tree - filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day - I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men and women - my own features - mock me with a resemblance.","But you will not speak of what I tell you; and my thoughts are so eternally absent that I am tempted to entrust them to someone else. Five minutes ago, Hareton seemed to me a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt so differently about him that it would have been impossible for me to speak to him rationally. In the first place, his striking resemblance to Catherine bound him to her in a terrible way. Yet what you may take to be the strongest stimulus to my imagination is in reality the least: for what is not connected with her? And what does not remind me of her? I cannot look upon this ground without seeing her features in the flagstones! In every cloud, in every tree—filling the sky at night and discernible in every object by day—I am surrounded by her image! The most commonplace faces of men and women—my own—taunted me with their resemblance."
"The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her! Well, Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my anguish 'But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together. I can give them no attention any more.' 'But what do you mean by a CHANGE, Mr. Heathcliff?' I said, alarmed at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine. 'I shall not know that till it comes,' he said; 'I'm only half conscious of it now.' 'You have no feeling of illness, have you?' I asked. 'No, Nelly, I have not,' he answered. 'Then you are not afraid of death?' I pursued. 'Afraid? No!' he replied. 'I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, nor a hope of death.","The whole world is now nothing but a horrible heap of memories of his existence and my loss! Hareton's appearance was now the shadow of my undying love, my desperate attempts to assert my rights, my humiliation, my pride, my happiness, and my fear. ""But it is foolish to repeat these thoughts to you: you will only understand why, as he does not always wish to be alone, his company is of no use; it rather aggravates my constant torment; and it partly contributes to my inability to understand how he and his cousin get along. I can no longer pay any attention to them."" ""But what do you mean by CHANGE, Mr. Heathcliff?"" I asked, surprised at his behavior. Yet, in my opinion, he was in no danger of losing his mind or dying: he was perfectly strong and healthy; and as for his mind, he had, since childhood, delighted in thinking obscure things and entertaining strange fancies. He was perhaps a little monomaniacal about his deceased idol, but in every other respect he was as perceptive as I. ""I'll only know in due time,"" he said; ""I'm only half aware of it now."" ""You don't feel ill, do you?"" I asked. ""No, Nelly, I don't,"" he replied. ""Then you're not afraid of death?"" I continued. ""Afraid? No!"" he replied. ""I have no fear, no premonition, no hope of dying."""
"Why should I? With my hard constitution and temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and probably SHALL, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to remind myself to breathe - almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it.","Why should I? With my austere constitution, temperate lifestyle, and harmless pursuits, I could, and probably will, remain on the surface until not a hair remains. And yet I cannot remain in this state! I must remember to breathe—almost remind my heart to beat! And it is like twisting a stiff spring: out of compulsion I perform the slightest action not prompted by a single thought; and out of compulsion I perceive everything, animate or inanimate, that is not connected with a universal idea. I have a single desire, and my whole being and all my power yearn to gratify it."
"They have yearned towards it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached - and soon - because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!' He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell.","You have desired it so long and so ardently that I am convinced it will be attained—and soon—for it has occupied my whole life: the expectation of its fulfillment consumes me. My confessions have not calmed me; but they may explain certain otherwise inexplicable outbursts of anger which I manifest. ""Oh dear! It is a long struggle; I wish it were over!"" He began to pace the room, muttering horrible things to himself, until, as he said, Joseph's act, I became convinced that his conscience had transformed his heart into an earthly hell."
"I wondered greatly how it would end. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.","I was very curious to see how it would end. Although he had rarely shown this mood before, even by his appearance, it was his usual mood, I had no doubt about it. He declared it himself; but no one would have guessed it from his general demeanor. Nor would you, when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood. And at the time I speak of, he was exactly the same as he was then; only he loved eternal solitude more and was perhaps even more taciturn in company."
"FOR some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy. He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him. One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and out at the front door.","For a few days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff avoided meeting us at dinner; yet he did not formally exclude Hareton and Cathy. He hated giving in to his feelings so completely and preferred to stay out of each other's way; one meal every twenty-four hours seemed sufficient to him. One evening, after the family had gone to bed, I heard him come downstairs and go out by the front door."
"I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the influence of Joseph's complaints.","I never heard him come in again, and the next morning I noticed that he was still not there. It was now April: the weather was mild and warm, the grass as green as sunshine and rain could make it, and the two dwarf apple trees against the south wall were in full blossom. After breakfast, Catherine insisted that I fetch a chair and sit under the pines at the end of the house to work; and she persuaded Hareton, who had fully recovered from his accident, to dig and cultivate his little garden, which he had moved there because of Joseph's illness."
"I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was coming in. 'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a perplexed countenance. 'What did he say?' asked Hareton. 'He told me to begone as fast as I could,' she answered. 'But he looked so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him.' 'How?' he inquired. 'Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, ALMOST nothing - VERY MUCH excited, and wild, and glad!' she replied. 'Night-walking amuses him, then,' I remarked, affecting a careless manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in.","I was enjoying the spring fragrance around me and the beautiful, soft blue sky when my young wife, who had run to the gate to fetch primrose roots for a bed, returned half-laden and announced Mr. Heathcliff's arrival. ""And he spoke to me,"" she added in surprise. ""What did he say?"" asked Hareton. ""He told me to go as quickly as possible,"" she replied. ""But he looked so different from his usual self that I stood staring at him for a moment."" ""How?"" he asked. ""Well, almost cheerful and jolly. No, ALMOST nothing—VERY excited, spirited, and happy!"" she replied. ""Evening strolls amuse him then,"" I remarked casually: indeed, as surprised as she was, and eager to know the truth behind his words; for to see the gentleman happy would not be a common sight. I sought an excuse to enter."
"Heathcliff stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole face. 'Will you have some breakfast?' I said. 'You must be hungry, rambling about all night!' I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not like to ask directly. 'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour. I felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition. 'I don't think it right to wander out of doors,' I observed, 'instead of being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I daresay you'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with you now!' 'Nothing but what I can bear,' he replied; 'and with the greatest pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.' I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat. 'Yes!' I reflected to myself, 'we shall have a fit of illness.","Heathcliff stood at the open door; he was pale and trembling; but there was undoubtedly a strange, cheerful gleam in his eyes, which gave a different expression to his face. ""Will you have breakfast?"" I asked. ""You must be hungry after wandering about all night!"" I wanted to know where he had gone, but I did not want to ask him directly. ""No, I am not hungry,"" he answered, turning his head away and speaking with a certain contempt, as if he suspected that I was trying to guess the reason for his good humor. I was perplexed: I did not know whether this was not an opportunity to reprove him a little. ""I do not think it would be right to go out,"" I remarked, ""instead of lying in bed: it is not wise, at least not in this wet season. I'll wager you will catch a bad cold or a fever: there is something wrong with you now!"" ""Nothing, except what I can bear,"" he replied; ""And with the greatest pleasure, provided you leave me alone: Come upstairs and don't disturb me."" I obeyed; and as I passed, I noticed that he was breathing rapidly like a cat. ""Yes!"" I said to myself, ""we're going to be sick."""
"I cannot conceive what he has been doing.' That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting. 'I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,' he remarked, in allusion to my morning's speech; 'and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.' He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had grieved him some way. 'Well, is he coming?' cried Catherine, when her cousin returned. 'Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.' I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same unnatural - it was unnatural - appearance of joy under his black brows; the same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates - a strong thrilling, rather than trembling.","I can't imagine what he did. That afternoon, he sat down at table with us and took a plateful from me, as if making up for his fast of the previous day. ""I have neither cold nor fever, Nelly,"" he remarked, alluding to my morning conversation; ""and I am ready to do justice to the food you give me."" He took a knife and fork and was about to begin his meal when his appetite seemed to suddenly disappear. He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, then got up and went out. We watched him pace the garden while we finished our meal, and Earnshaw said he would ask why he didn't eat; he thought we had hurt him somehow. ""Well, is he coming?"" called Catherine, as her cousin returned. ""No,"" he answered; ""but he is not angry; he seldom seemed really happy; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he asked me to go to you: he wondered how I could possibly want anyone else's company."" I put his plate on the edge to keep it warm; and in an hour or two he came back, when the room was empty, but no less calm: the same unearthly joy—it was unearthly—beneath his black brows; the same bloodless color, and his teeth were visible now and then in a kind of smile; his body trembled, not as a man trembles from cold or weakness, but as a taut rope trembles—a strong tremor instead of a shiver."
"I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I exclaimed - 'Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look uncommonly animated.' 'Where should good news come from to me?' he said. 'I'm animated with hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.' 'Your dinner is here,' I returned; 'why won't you get it?' 'I don't want it now,' he muttered, hastily: 'I'll wait till supper. And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to myself.' 'Is there some new reason for this banishment?' I inquired. 'Tell me why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I'm not putting the question through idle curiosity, but - ' 'You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,' he interrupted, with a laugh. 'Yet I'll answer it.","I'll ask what's the matter, I told myself; or who would? And I cried out: ""Have you any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look unusually cheerful."" ""Where can I get any good news?"" he asked. ""I'm starving, and apparently I mustn't eat anything."" ""Your supper is here,"" I answered; ""Why don't you get it?"" ""I don't want it now,"" he murmured hastily. ""I'll wait until supper. And, Nelly, I want to ask you once and for all to keep Hareton and the others away from me. I won't be disturbed by anyone; I want this place to myself."" ""Is there any new reason for this banishment?"" I asked. ""Tell me why you're behaving so strangely, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I don't ask that question from mere curiosity, but—"" ""You ask that question from mere curiosity,"" he interrupted, laughing. ""And yet I'm going to answer him."""
"Last night I was on the threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you'd better go! You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from prying.' Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed than ever.","Last night I stood on the threshold of hell. Today I have my paradise within sight. I stared at it: barely a meter separates me! And now go! You won't see or hear anything that could frighten you if you don't take the trouble. After sweeping the fireplace and wiping the table, I left, more confused than ever."
"He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on his solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large stones which it could not cover.","He did not leave the house again that afternoon, and no one disturbed his solitude until, at eight o'clock, I thought it best to bring him, without being asked, a candle and his supper. He was leaning on the edge of an open grate, but not looking out: his face was turned towards the inner darkness. The fire had burned down; the room was filled with the moist, sweet air of that cloudy evening; and it was so still that one could hear not only the murmur of the stream that flowed near Gimmerton, but also its trickle and splash on the pebbles, or through the large stones that it could not cover."
"I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his. 'Must I close this?' I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not stir. The light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me, not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness. 'Yes, close it,' he replied, in his familiar voice. 'There, that is pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick, and bring another.' I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph - 'The master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.' For I dared not go in myself again just then.","At the sight of the gloomy grille, I uttered a cry of displeasure and began closing the windows one by one until I reached his own. ""Shall I close this one?"" I asked, to rouse him; for he did not move. The light shone upon his face as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot describe how terrified I was by that fleeting sight! Those pitch-black eyes! That smile and that hideous pallor! It did not look to me like Mr. Heathcliff, but like a gnome; and, filled with fear, I bent the candle toward the wall, and he left me in the dark. ""Yes, close it,"" he answered in his familiar voice. ""That is clumsy! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Come quickly and bring another."" Mad with fear, I rushed out and said to Joseph, ""The master wants you to bring him some light and cheer him up."" “Because at that moment I didn’t dare go in myself.”"
"Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he had rather we had no suspicion. 'Is he a ghoul or a vampire?' I mused. I had read of such hideous incarnate demons.","Joseph threw a little fire into the shovel and went away, but immediately brought it back, tray in other hand, and announced that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed and would not eat anything until morning. We heard him immediately come upstairs; he did not want to go into his usual room, but into the one with the paneled bed; the window, as I said, is large enough for anyone to pass through; and I noticed that he was planning another nighttime excursion of which he preferred not to suspect. ""Is it a ghoul or a vampire?"" I wondered. I had read about these hideous, incarnate demons."
"And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror. 'But where did he come from, the little dark thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?' muttered Superstition, as I dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, 'Heathcliff.' That came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his headstone, only that, and the date of his death.","And then I began to think about how I had nursed him as a baby, watched him grow up, and accompanied him almost his entire life; and how absurd to give in to that feeling of horror! ""But where did he come from, this dark little thing, nurtured to ruin by a good man?"" murmured Superstition as I fell asleep. And half-dreaming, I began to imagine a lineage appropriate to him; and, reflecting on my waking thoughts, I traced his existence with grim variations; finally, I imagined his death and burial: I only remember how much it vexed me to dictate an inscription for his tomb and to consult the sexton about it; and since he had no surname and we could not determine his age, we had to be content with the single word ""Heathcliff."" It became true: we were. Upon entering the cemetery, one can read only this on his tombstone, along with the date of his death."
"Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window. There were none. 'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'll be all right to-day.' I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came down, for he lay late.","Dawn brought me back to my senses. I got up and went out into the garden as quickly as possible to see if there were any footprints below his window. There were none. ""He's stayed home,"" I thought, ""and he'll be fine today."" I made breakfast for the whole family as usual, but asked Hareton and Catherine to make theirs before the master came down, as he was getting home late."
"They preferred taking it out of doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them. On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more exaggerated.","They preferred to sit outside under the trees, and I set a small table for them. When I returned, I found Mr. Heathcliff downstairs. He and Joseph were discussing agricultural matters; he gave clear and detailed instructions, but spoke quickly, constantly turning his head away, and showing the same, if not greater, agitation."
"When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him. He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together. 'Come now,' I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, 'eat and drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.' He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled. I'd rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so. 'Mr. Heathcliff! master!' I cried, 'don't, for God's sake, stare as if you saw an unearthly vision.' 'Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,' he replied. 'Turn round, and tell me, are we by ourselves?' 'Of course,' was my answer; 'of course we are.' Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.","When Joseph left the room, he sat down in his usual place, and I placed a cup of coffee before him. He brought it closer, rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite wall. I suspected he was examining some part of it from top to bottom with bright, anxious eyes, and with such lively interest that he held his breath for half a minute. ""Now, now,"" I cried, pressing some bread into his hand, ""eat and drink this while it's still hot: he's been waiting nearly an hour."" He didn't notice me, yet he smiled. I would have preferred to see him grind his teeth than smile like that. ""Mr. Heathcliff! Master!"" I cried, ""for goodness' sake, don't stare at me as if you were seeing a vision from another world."" ""For goodness' sake, don't shout so loudly,"" he replied. ""Turn around and tell me, are we alone?"" ""Of course,"" I answered, ""of course."" Yet I obeyed him involuntarily, as if I weren't entirely sure."
"With a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease. Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards' distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.","With a wave of his hand, he made room in front of him in the middle of breakfast and leaned forward to continue his silent gaze. I noticed that he wasn't looking at the wall; for when I observed him alone, I had the impression he was staring at something two meters away. And whatever it was, it evidently expressed pleasure and pain in exquisite and refined forms: at least, that's what the tortured and ecstatic expression on his face suggested."
"The fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim. I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn't wait: I might set the things down and go.","The object, too, was not fixed: his gaze followed it with tireless impatience, and even when he spoke to me, he was undeterred. In vain, I reminded him of his long abstinence from food: when he wanted to touch something to fulfill my requests, when he reached for a piece of bread, his fingers twitched before he reached it and remained on the table, unaware of their purpose. Sitting down, a model of patience, I tried to distract him from his thoughts until he stood up, irritated, and asked me why I didn't give him time to eat. And I told him that next time I wouldn't have to wait: I could put my things down and leave."
"Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate. The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.","With that, he left the house, walked slowly along the garden path, and disappeared under the gate. The hours passed anxiously: another evening was dawning. I didn't go to bed until late, and when I did, I couldn't sleep."
"He returned after midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.","He returned after midnight and, instead of going to bed, locked himself in the room downstairs. I listened, tossed and turned a little, finally got dressed and went downstairs. It was too exhausting to lie there, tormenting my mind with a thousand empty thoughts."
"I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor, and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and began to scrape the cinders.","I heard Mr. Heathcliff's footsteps as he paced anxiously back and forth, and every now and then he broke the silence with a deep, groaning inspiration. He also murmured single words; the only one I could understand was the name Catherine, accompanied by a strange address, affectionate or sad; and he pronounced it as one addresses someone: softly and seriously, and it came from the depths of his soul. I didn't have the courage to go directly into the apartment; but I wanted to distract him from his reveries, so I let myself be carried away by the kitchen fire, stoked it, and began to scrape the embers."
"It drew him forth sooner than I expected. He opened the door immediately, and said - 'Nelly, come here - is it morning? Come in with your light.' 'It is striking four,' I answered. 'You want a candle to take up- stairs: you might have lit one at this fire.' 'No, I don't wish to go up-stairs,' he said. 'Come in, and kindle ME a fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.' 'I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,' I replied, getting a chair and the bellows He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between. 'When day breaks I'll send for Green,' he said; 'I wish to make some legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to leave my property I cannot determine.","This brought him out earlier than expected. He immediately opened the door and said to me, ""Nelly, come here, is it morning? Come in with your lamp."" ""It's striking four,"" I replied. ""You need a candle; you could have lit it here by the fire."" ""No, I won't come up,"" he said. ""Come in, light me a fire, and do what needs doing in the room."" ""I have to light the embers first before I can carry them,"" I replied, grabbing a chair and the bellows. Meanwhile, he paced frantically back and forth; his heavy sighs followed one another so loudly that there was no room for a collective intake of breath. ""At daybreak, I'll have Green summoned,"" he said. ""I want to initiate some legal proceedings against him while I think things over and can act in peace. I haven't made my will yet; and how I will leave my estate, I don't yet know."""
"I wish I could annihilate it from the face of the earth.' 'I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed. 'Let your will be a while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault. The way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do take some food, and some repose.","I wish I could erase it from the face of the earth. ""I wouldn't speak like that, Mr. Heathcliff,"" I interrupted. ""Let your will hold out a little longer: you'll have time to repent of your many mistakes! I didn't think your nerves would be on the verge of breaking down. Yet, astonishing as it may seem, they are right now; and almost entirely through your own fault. The way you've spent the last three days, a Titan might wake up. Eat and rest."""
"You need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes blood- shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.' 'It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,' he replied. 'I assure you it is through no settled designs. I'll do both, as soon as I possibly can.","You only have to look in the mirror to see how much you need both. Your cheeks are sunken and your eyes bloodshot, as if you're starving and going blind from lack of sleep. ""It's not my fault I can't eat or rest,"" he replied. ""I assure you, it's not my intention. I will do both, as soon as possible."""
"But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms' length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then I'll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices, I've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I'm too happy; and yet I'm not happy enough.","But you might as well ask a man struggling in the water to rest an arm's length from the shore! I must get there first, and then I will rest. Now, leave Mr. Green alone: as for remorse for my wrongs, I have done nothing wrong and regret nothing. I am too happy; and yet I am not happy enough."
"My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not satisfy itself.' 'Happy, master?' I cried. 'Strange happiness! If you would hear me without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you happier.' 'What is that?' he asked. 'Give it.' 'You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,' I said, 'that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one - some minister of any denomination, it does not matter which - to explain it, and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?' 'I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,' he said, 'for you remind me of the manner in which I desire to be buried.","The bliss of my soul kills my body, but it is not satisfied. ""Happy, Master?"" I cried. ""Strange happiness! If you would listen to me without anger, perhaps I could give you some advice that would make you happier."" ""What?"" he asked. ""Give it."" ""Do you know, Mr. Heathcliff,"" I said, ""that since you were thirteen, you have lived a selfish and unchristian life, and that in all that time you have probably hardly ever held a Bible in your hand. You have probably forgotten the contents of the book and perhaps no longer have time to consult it. Would it be dangerous to call someone—a minister of any denomination, it doesn't matter which—to explain it to you and show you how far you have strayed from his commandments and how unworthy you will be of this paradise if something is not changed before your death?"" ""I am more grateful than angry, Nelly,"" he said, ""because you remind me how I want to be buried."""
"It is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor need anything be said over me. - I tell you I have nearly attained MY heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncovered by me.' 'And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?' I said, shocked at his godless indifference. 'How would you like it?' 'They won't do that,' he replied: 'if they did, you must have me removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the dead are not annihilated!' As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.","It must be taken to the cemetery this evening. You and Hareton can accompany me if you wish. Above all, see that the sexton follows my instructions regarding the two coffins! The coming of a priest is pointless; there is nothing to say about me. I tell you, I have almost reached MY heaven; the other's is unimportant, and I will not betray it. ""And suppose you persist in your obstinate fasting and die from it, and they refuse to bury you on the church grounds?"" I asked, shocked by his impious indifference. ""What do you mean?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""If so, you must have me secretly removed; and if not, you practically prove that the dead are not exterminated!"" As soon as he heard the other family members stir, he retired to his study, and I breathed more freely. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were working, he returned to the kitchen, looked at me in bewilderment, and asked me to sit beside him. He wanted someone to be with him."
"I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone. 'I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh: 'something too horrible to live under a decent roof.' Then turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he added, half sneeringly, - 'Will YOU come, chuck? I'll not hurt you. No! to you I've made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is ONE who won't shrink from my company! By God! she's relentless.","I refused, telling him openly that his strange language and behavior frightened me, and I had neither the courage nor the desire to be alone with him. ""I think you take me for a devil,"" he said with his grim smile, ""something too vile to live under a decent roof."" Then, turning to Catherine, who was there and had stood behind me as he approached, he added, half-mockingly, ""Will you come with me, Chuck? I won't hurt you. No! Because of you, I've made myself worse than the devil. There's one who won't shrink from my company! By God! She's merciless."""
"Oh, damn it! It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear - even mine.' He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself.","Oh, damn! This is indescribably too hard for flesh and blood, even for me. He no longer sought company. As night fell, he returned to his room. All night and into the early hours, we heard him moaning and muttering."
"Hareton was anxious to enter; but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be left alone; so the doctor went away.","Hareton was desperate to get in, but I told him to get Mr. Kenneth; he would visit him. When he arrived, I asked to be admitted and tried to open the door, but it was locked. Heathcliff said we were lost. He was feeling better and wanted to be alone; so the doctor left."
"The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master's window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He must either be up or out.","The following evening was very rainy; it even rained until morning; and as I took my morning walk around the house, I saw the professor's window open and the rain pouring down in torrents. He couldn't be in bed, I thought: those showers would soak him completely. He had to be standing or outside."
"But I'll make no more ado, I'll go boldly and look.' Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there - laid on his back. His eyes met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.","But I won't make a fuss, I'll go boldly and see to it."" I entered with another key and ran to open the panels, for the room was empty. I quickly pushed them aside and peered inside. Mr. Heathcliff lay there on his back. His gaze met mine with such sharpness and force that I flinched; then he seemed to smile."
"I could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could doubt no more: he was dead and stark! I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful, life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I cried out for Joseph.","I couldn't believe he was dead, but his face and neck were soaked with rain; the sheets were dripping, and he lay perfectly still. The slamming of the grate had grazed a hand on the windowsill; no blood flowed from his abraded skin, and when I placed my fingers there, I could no longer doubt: he was dead, dead! I rushed to the window; I pulled his long black hair back from his forehead; I tried to close his eyes, to extinguish, if possible, that terrifying, vivid expression of joy before anyone saw it. They refused to close: they seemed to mock my attempts; and his parted lips and pointed white teeth mocked me too! Overcome by a new wave of cowardice, I called Joseph."
"Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but resolutely refused to meddle with him. 'Th' divil's harried off his soul,' he cried, 'and he may hev' his carcass into t' bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked 'un he looks, girning at death!' and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights. I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.","Joseph shuffled forward and made a noise, but stubbornly refused to intervene. ""The devil has torn out his soul,"" he cried, ""and he can even give me his body in return! Ah! How miserable he looks, so close to death!"" The old sinner smiled mockingly. I thought he was joking by the bedside; but suddenly he came to his senses, fell to his knees, raised his hands, and thanked his rightful master and the old family for their place back. I was stunned by this terrible event; and my memories inevitably returned with a depressing sadness."
"But poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.","But poor Hareton, who suffered most from his grief, was the only one who suffered deeply. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping bitterly and sincerely. He pressed the hand and kissed the sarcastic and grim face that everyone ignored; and he wept for her with that deep sorrow that springs from a generous heart, even one as hard as tempered steel."
"Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause. We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.","Mr. Kenneth couldn't determine what illness the gentleman had died of. I concealed the fact that he hadn't eaten for four days, for fear it might upset him. Furthermore, I'm convinced he hadn't abstained voluntarily: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause. We buried him, as he had wished, to the great dismay of the entire neighborhood."
"Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds - and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly.","Earnshaw, myself, the sexton, and six men who were to carry the coffin made up the entire assembly. The six men left after lowering the coffin into the grave; we stayed to attend the funeral. Hareton, his face streaming with blood, dug up some green turf and laid it himself on the brown earth. It is now as smooth and green as the surrounding hills, and I hope its occupant is sleeping as soundly."
"But the country folks, if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he WALKS: there are those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this house. Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I. Yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:- and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago.","But the country folk, if asked, would swear on the Bible that he is GONE: some claim to have met him in the church, on the moor, and even in this house. Nonsense, you may say, and I say it too. Yet this old man by the kitchen fire claims to have seen two of them looking out of his bedroom window every rainy night since his death: and a strange thing happened to me about a month ago."
"I was going to the Grange one evening - a dark evening, threatening thunder - and, just at the turn of the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be guided. 'What is the matter, my little man?' I asked. 'There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab,' he blubbered, 'un' I darnut pass 'em.' I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don't like being out in the dark now; and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange. 'They are going to the Grange, then?' I said. 'Yes,' answered Mrs. Dean, 'as soon as they are married, and that will be on New Year's Day.' 'And who will live here then?' 'Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him company.","I was walking to the Grange one evening—it was dark and a thunderstorm threatened—and just as the hills began to curve, I met a small boy with a sheep and two lambs in front of him. He was crying terribly; I assumed the lambs were nervous and refused to be led. ""What's the matter, little man?"" I asked. ""There's Heathcliff and a woman under the tree,"" he replied, ""waiting until I can outrun them."" I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go any farther, so I told him to take the lower path. He probably wanted to lighten the mood, for as he walked alone across the moor, he was thinking about the nonsense his parents and companions had been telling. Still, I don't like being in the dark now; and I don't like being alone in this gloomy house: I can't help it; I shall be glad when they leave it and go to the Grange. ""Will they go to the Grange then?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" Mrs. Dean replied, ""as soon as they are married, which will be on New Year's Day."" ""And who will live here then?"" ""Well, Joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a boy to keep him company."""
"They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.' 'For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?' I observed. 'No, Mr. Lockwood,' said Nelly, shaking her head. 'I believe the dead are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.' At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning. 'THEY are afraid of nothing,' I grumbled, watching their approach through the window. 'Together, they would brave Satan and all his legions.' As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at the moon - or, more correctly, at each other by her light - I felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door; and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet. My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.","They will live in the kitchen, and the others will be locked away. ""For the ghosts who want to live there?"" I remarked. ""No, Mr. Lockwood,"" said Nelly, shaking her head. ""I believe the dead rest in peace, but one shouldn't speak lightly of it."" At that moment, the garden gate flew open; the walkers returned. ""They are fearless,"" I murmured, watching them through the window. ""Together, they would defy Satan and all his legions."" As they stepped through the door and paused to take one last look at the moon—or, more accurately, to see each other in its light—I felt an irresistible urge to escape them again. I pressed a souvenir into Mrs. Dean's hand, ignored her warnings about my rudeness, and disappeared through the kitchen as they opened the front door. Joseph would have had to confirm his opinion of his fellow servant's amusing indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognized in me an honorable man, with the sweet voice of a prince at his feet. My return journey was prolonged by a detour to the church. There, beneath the walls, I saw that decay was already advanced, even after seven months: many windows had black holes without glass; and here and there, slate slabs protruded beyond the straight line of the roof, which would gradually be eroded in the coming autumn storms."
"I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: on middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's still bare. I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.

I lingered there under the mild sky, watching the moths flutter among the heather and bluebells, listening to the gentle breeze stirring the grass, and wondering how anyone could imagine troubled sleep for sleepers in this silent land.
