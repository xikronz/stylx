"""So you're all set for money, then?"" the boy named Crow asks in his typical sluggish voice. The kind of voice like when you've just woken up and your mouth still feels heavy and dull. But he's just pretending.","“Okay, so everyone’s ready to make some money, right?” the boy named Crow asks, using a slow, sluggish voice—the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s just woken up and still has a numb mouth. Actually, he’s just pretending."
"He's totally awake. As always. I nod. ""How much?"" I review the numbers in my head. ""Close to thirty-five hundred in cash, plus some money I can get from an ATM.","He’s just as awake as always. I nod and ask, “How much?” I do the math in my head: “Almost three thousand five hundred in cash, plus some more money that I can withdraw from an ATM.”"
"I know it's not a lot, but it should be enough. For the time being."" ""Not bad,"" the boy named Crow says. ""For the time being."" I give him another nod. ""I'm guessing this isn't Christmas money from Santa Claus."" ""Yeah, you're right,"" I reply. Crow smirks and looks around. ""I imagine you've started by rifling drawers, am I right?"" I don't say anything.","I know it’s not much, but for now it’ll have to do.   “Not bad,” says the boy named Crow. “At least for now.” I nod at him again.   “I guess this isn’t the Christmas money from Saint Nicholas…”   “Yes, you’re right,” I reply.   Crow smiles and looks around. “I suppose you started looking in the cabinets, didn’t you?”   I don’t say anything."
"He knows whose money we're talking about, so there's no need for any long-winded interrogations. He's just giving me a hard time. ""No matter,"" Crow says. ""You really need this money and you're going to get it--beg, borrow, or steal. It's your father's money, so who cares, right? Get your hands on that much and you should be able to make it.","He knows exactly what those funds are; so all those endless interrogations are pointless. He’s just trying to make my life difficult. “But that doesn’t matter,” Crow says. “You really need that money, and you’re going to get it—whether you ask for it, borrow it, or steal it. It’s your father’s money after all… Who cares? Once you have it, you’ll have to be able to find your own way.”"
"For the time being. But what's the plan after it's all gone? Money isn't like mushrooms in a forest--it doesn't just pop up on its own, you know. You'll need to eat, a place to sleep.","Yes, for right now certainly, but what’s the plan after all this is over? Money doesn’t grow on its own, just like frogs don’t appear out of the forest… I think you get the idea. You’ll need food and a place to sleep."
"One day you're going to run out."" ""I'll think about that when the time comes,"" I say. ""When the time comes,"" Crow repeats, as if weighing these words in his hand. I nod. ""Like by getting a job or something?"" ""Maybe,"" I say. Crow shakes his head. ""You know, you've got a lot to learn about the world.","“One day, everything will be over.”   “I’ll think about that when the time comes,” I say.   “When the time comes,” the raven repeats, as if weighing those words in its hands. I nod.   “Maybe by finding a job or something?”   “Maybe,” I answer.   The raven shakes its head.   “You know… there’s still so much to learn about the world.”"
"Listen--what kind of job could a fifteen-year-old kid get in some far-off place he's never been to before? You haven't even finished junior high. Who do you think's going to hire you?"" I blush a little. It doesn't take much to make me blush. ""Forget it,"" he says. ""You're just getting started and I shouldn't lay all this depressing stuff on you.","“Listen,” he said, “what kind of job could a fifteen-year-old boy find in a remote place where he’s never been before? You haven’t even finished high school yet. Who would be interested in hiring you?” My face turned red; there aren’t many things that make me blush. “Let’s forget about that,” he said. “You’ve just started, and I don’t want to burden you with so much pessimism.”"
"You've already decided what you're going to do, and all that's left is to set the wheels in motion. I mean, it's your life. Basically you gotta go with what you think is right."" That's right.","You’ve already made up your mind about what you’re going to do; all that’s left is to put those plans into action. After all, this is your life, and you have to do what you think is right. And that’s exactly what’s happening in this case."
"When all is said and done, it is my life. ""I'll tell you one thing, though. You're going to have to get a lot tougher if you want to make it."" ""I'm trying my best,"" I say. ""I'm sure you are,"" Crow says. ""These last few years you've gotten a whole lot stronger. I've got to hand it to you."" I nod again. ""But let's face it--you're only fifteen,"" Crow goes on. ""Your life's just begun and there's a ton of things out in the world you've never laid eyes on.","In the end, it’s still my life. “One thing’s for sure: you need to become much stronger if you want to achieve success,” he says. “I’ll do my best,” I reply. “I’m sure of that,” Crow adds. “You’ve really made a lot of progress in the past few years; you have to admit that.” I nod again. “But let’s be realistic: you’re only fifteen years old. Your life has just begun, and there are so many things in this world that you’ve yet to see…”"
"Things you never could imagine."" As always, we're sitting beside each other on the old sofa in my father's study. Crow loves the study and all the little objects scattered around there. Now he's toying with a bee-shaped glass paperweight.","“Things that you can never even imagine…” Just like always, we’re sitting side by side on the old bench in my father’s office. Crow really likes that office and all the little objects there. Right now, he’s playing with a glass letter opener in the shape of a bee."
"If my father was at home, you can bet Crow would never go anywhere near it. ""But I have to get out of here,"" I tell him. ""No two ways around it."" ""Yeah, I guess you're right."" He places the paperweight back on the table and links his hands behind his head. ""Not that running away's going to solve everything. I don't want to rain on your parade or anything, but I wouldn't count on escaping this place if I were you. No matter how far you run.","When my father was at home, I can assure you that Crow would never have dared to come near this area. “But I have to get out of here,” I told him. “There’s no other option.” “Yes, I think you’re right,” he said. He placed the paper clip back on the table and folded his hands behind his head. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that escaping will solve all our problems… I don’t want to dampen your hopes, but if I were in your position, I wouldn’t expect to be able to leave this place, no matter how far I tried to walk.”"
"Distance might not solve anything."" The boy named Crow lets out a sigh, then rests a fingertip on each of his closed eyelids and speaks to me from the darkness within. ""How about we play our game?"" he says. ""All right,"" I say. I close my eyes and quietly take a deep breath. ""Okay, picture a terrible sandstorm,"" he says. ""Get everything else out of your head."" I do what he says, get everything else out of my head. I forget who I am, even.","“The distance might not make any difference…” sighs the boy named Crow. He places the tip of his finger on each of his closed eyelids and speaks to me from the darkness surrounding him. “What do you think? Shall we play our game?” he asks. “Okay,” I say. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. “Now, imagine a terrifying sandstorm… Forget everything else from your mind,” he commands. I obey; I erase everything from my thoughts—even who I am."
"I'm a total blank. Then things start to surface. Things that--as we sit here on the old leather sofa in my father's study--both of us can see. ""Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions,"" Crow says.","I don’t remember anything at all… Then, little by little, certain things start to resurface in my memory—things we experienced together, while sitting on that old leather bench in my father’s office. “Sometimes fate is like a tiny sandstorm that keeps changing direction,” Crow says."
"Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts.","Sometimes, fate is just like a small sandstorm that keeps changing direction constantly. You try to change your own course, but the sandstorm still follows you. You turn around again, and the sandstorm adjusts its path once more."
"Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you.","Once again, these scenes are played out, as if they represent a dark “dance” with death—just before dawn breaks. Why? Because this storm did not come from some distant corner; it has nothing to do with you… This storm… you are it."
"Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time.","There’s something within you… The only thing you can do is to surrender to this state of consciousness, to fully immerse yourself in this “storm”: close your eyes, block out your ears so the sand can’t reach you, and keep moving forward, step by step. There’s no sun or moon, no direction… and no sense of time either."
"Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine. And that's exactly what I do.","It’s just ordinary white sand powder that’s being blown into the air, just like powdered bones. You have to imagine what such a sandstorm simulation would look like… And that’s exactly what I’m doing."
"I imagine a white funnel stretching up vertically like a thick rope. My eyes are closed tight, hands cupped over my ears, so those fine grains of sand can't blow inside me. The sandstorm draws steadily closer.","I imagine a white cone of sand rising straight up into the air, just like a thick rope. I keep my eyes tightly closed and put my hands over my ears to prevent those tiny sand particles from getting inside my body. The sandstorm is getting closer and closer…"
"I can feel the air pressing on my skin. It really is going to swallow me up. The boy called Crow softly rests a hand on my shoulder, and with that the storm vanishes. ""From now on--no matter what--you've got to be the world's toughest fifteenyear-old.","I can feel the air pressing heavily against my skin; it’s going to swallow me whole. The boy named Crow gently puts a hand on my shoulder, and instantly the storm passes. “From now on, no matter what happens, you must become the strongest of all fifteen-year-olds in the world.”"
"That's the only way you're going to survive. And in order to do that, you've got to figure out what it means to be tough. You following me?"" I keep my eyes closed and don't reply.","This is the only way to survive. To achieve that, you must understand what it means to be strong and resilient… Are you following me? I close my eyes and don’t answer."
"I just want to sink off into sleep like this, his hand on my shoulder. I hear the faint flutter of wings. ""You're going to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old,"" Crow whispers as I try to fall asleep. Like he was carving the words in a deep blue tattoo on my heart.","I just want to fall asleep like this… with his hand on my shoulder. I hear the soft rustling of his wings… “You will become the strongest of all the boys in the world,” Crow whispers as I try to fall asleep. It’s as if he’s engraving these words into my heart with a deep blue tattoo."
"And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too.","And you really have to overcome this huge stormfront—whether it’s of a metaphysical or symbolic nature: it will cause people just as much pain as thousands of sharp knives would. People will bleed… and so will you."
"Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others. And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive.","Jullie sing with passion… a “red” voice. You will hold this flow of blood in your hands: your own blood, and the blood of others. And when the storm is over, you will no longer remember how you survived."
"You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in.","In fact, you might not even be sure whether the storm has truly passed. One thing is for sure, however: if you survive this storm, you will never be the same person as you were before."
"That's what this storm's all about. On my fifteenth birthday I'll run away from home, journey to a far-off town, and live in a corner of a small library. It'd take a week to go into the whole thing, all the details.","This is exactly what needs to be done: in order to prevent that storm from happening. On my fifteenth birthday, I will run away from home, travel to a distant city, and settle in a small corner of a tiny library. It would take a week to explain everything and share all the details with you."
"So I'll just give the main point. On my fifteenth birthday I'll run away from home, journey to a far-off town, and live in a corner of a small library. It sounds a little like a fairy tale.","Well, I’ll summarize the main points: On my fifteenth birthday, I will leave home and go to a distant city, where I will live in a small corner of a tiny library. It sounds a bit like a fairy tale…"
"But it's no fairy tale, believe me. No matter what sort of spin you put on it. Chapter 1 Cash isn't the only thing I take from my father's study when I leave home.","But this isn’t a fairy tale… Believe me. No matter how you interpret it, in the first chapter, money isn’t the only thing I take from my father’s office when I leave the house."
"I take a small, old gold lighter--I like the design and feel of it--and a folding knife with a really sharp blade. Made to skin deer, it has a five-inch blade and a nice heft. Probably something he bought on one of his trips abroad.","I’ll use a small, older gold lighter; I really like its design and texture. I’ll also add a foldable knife with a very sharp blade to it. This knife is specifically designed for removing the hide from deer; the blade is five inches long, and the knife feels comfortable in the hand. He probably bought it during one of his trips abroad."
"I also take a sturdy, bright pocket flashlight out of a drawer. Plus sky blue Revo sunglasses to disguise my age. I think about taking my father's favorite Sea-Dweller Oyster Rolex.","From a cabinet, I also take out a sturdy, shiny flashlight. Then I put on a pair of blue Revo sunglasses to hide my age. I hesitate for a moment before deciding whether to pick up the Rolex Sea-Dweller Oyster; after all, it’s my father’s favorite watch…"
"It's a beautiful watch, but something flashy will only attract attention. My cheap plastic Casio watch with an alarm and stopwatch will do just fine, and might actually be more useful. Reluctantly, I return the Rolex to its drawer.","It’s a really beautiful watch, but if something stands out too much, it just attracts unnecessary attention. My cheap plastic Casio watch, which comes with a wake-up function and a stopwatch, would be more than sufficient for my needs; it might even be more convenient. With regret, I put the Rolex watch back in the drawer."
"From the back of another drawer I take out a photo of me and my older sister when we were little, the two of us on a beach somewhere with grins plastered across our faces. My sister's looking off to the side so half her face is in shadow and her smile is neatly cut in half. It's like one of those Greek tragedy masks in a textbook that's half one idea and half the opposite.","From another cabinet, I take out a photo of me and my older sister when we were little. We’re both standing on the beach, with broad smiles on our faces. My sister is looking to the side; as a result, half of her face is in the shadow, and her smile seems to be divided into two equal parts. That reminds me a bit of the masks from Greek tragedies that we see in textbooks—those masks represent both an idea and its opposite at the same time."
"Light and dark. Hope and despair. Laughter and sadness.","Light and darkness. Hope and despair. Laughter and sorrow."
"Trust and loneliness. For my part I'm staring straight ahead, undaunted, at the camera. Nobody else is there at the beach.","Trust and loneliness… I look straight ahead, without fear, into the camera. There is no one else on the beach."
"My sister and I have on swimsuits--hers a red floral-print one-piece, mine some baggy old blue trunks. I'm holding a plastic stick in my hand. White foam is washing over our feet.","My sister and I are wearing swimsuits: hers is a one-piece bathing suit with a red floral pattern, and mine is an older, more baggy blue bathing suit. I’m holding a plastic stick in my hand; white foam is flowing down around my feet."
"Who took this, and where and when, I have no clue. And how could I have looked so happy? And why did my father keep just that one photo? The whole thing is a total mystery. I must have been three, my sister nine.","How did this photo get taken? Where, and when? I have no idea. How come I look so happy in it? And why did my father keep exactly this one photo? That’s really a mystery. I was probably three years old back then, and my sister was nine."
"Did we ever really get along that well? I have no memory of ever going to the beach with my family. No memory of going anywhere with them. No matter, though--there is no way I'm going to leave that photo with my father, so I put it in my wallet.","Were we really ever that close to each other in the first place? I can’t remember ever going to the beach with my family or traveling anywhere with them. But whatever… I’m definitely not going to get rid of this photo of me and my father; that’s why I’m putting it in my wallet."
"I don't have any photos of my mother. My father threw them all away. After giving it some thought I decide to take the cell phone with me.","I don’t have a single photo of my mother; my father threw them all away. After much thought, I decided to bring my mobile phone with me."
"Once he finds out I've taken it, my father will probably get the phone company to cut off service. Still, I toss it into my backpack, along with the adapter. Doesn't add much weight, so why not.","As soon as my father finds out that I have this device, he will probably ask the phone company to stop providing the service. Nevertheless, I still put the device along with the charger in my backpack; it doesn’t weigh much, so why not?"
"When it doesn't work anymore I'll just chuck it. Just the bare necessities, that's all I need. Choosing which clothes to take is the hardest thing.","When something stops working, I just throw it away. I only need the really essential things. Choosing the clothes I’m going to take with me is the hardest part."
"I'll need a couple sweaters and pairs of underwear. But what about shirts and trousers? Gloves, mufflers, shorts, a coat? There's no end to it. One thing I do know, though.","I know I need to buy some sweaters and underwear. But what about shirts and pants? Gloves, scarves, shorts, a jacket… the list goes on forever… One thing I’m sure of: there’s still plenty left to buy."
"I don't want to wander around some strange place with a huge backpack that screams out, Hey, everybody, check out the runaway! Do that and someone is sure to sit up and take notice. Next thing you know the police will haul me in and I'll be sent straight home. If I don't wind up in some gang first.","I don’t want to go hiking in an unfamiliar place with a large backpack; such a backpack would immediately attract everyone’s attention. If I did that, someone would definitely notice my presence. Then the police would take me away and send me straight home… At least if I don’t end up in the hands of a criminal gang first."
"Any place cold is definitely out, I decide. Easy enough, just choose the opposite--a warm place. Then I can leave the coat and gloves behind, and get by with half the clothes.","“Every cold place is out of the question,” you decide. It’s very simple: you just have to choose the opposite option, namely a warm place. That way, I can leave my jacket and gloves at home and be content with only half of my clothes."
"I pick out wash-and-wear-type things, the lightest ones I have, fold them neatly, and stuff them in my backpack. I also pack a three-season sleeping bag, the kind that rolls up nice and tight, toilet stuff, a rain poncho, notebook and pen, a Walkman and ten discs--got to have my music--along with a spare rechargeable battery. That's about it.","I choose clothes that are easy to wash and wear, as well as the lightest items I have. I fold them carefully and pack them into my backpack. In addition, I take a versatile cushion that’s suitable for all four seasons and easy to roll up, toiletries, a raincoat, a notebook with a pen, a Walkman, and ten CDs (I need my music), as well as a spare battery. That’s basically all I need."
"No need for any cooking gear, which is too heavy and takes up too much room, since I can buy food at the local convenience store. It takes a while but I'm able to subtract a lot of things from my list. I add things, cross them off, then add a whole other bunch and cross them off, too.","I don’t need any kitchen appliances; they’re too heavy and take up too much space. I can buy my food at the nearest supermarket. It does take a bit of time, but this way I can cross off many items from my list. Then I add new products to the list, cross them off again, add more products, and cross those out as well."
"My fifteenth birthday is the ideal time to run away from home. Any earlier and it'd be too soon. Any later and I would have missed my chance.","My fifteenth birthday is the perfect time to leave home. If I leave too early, I’ll still be too immature; if I leave too late, I’ll miss my chance."
"During my first two years in junior high, I'd worked out, training myself for this day. I started practicing judo in the first couple years of grade school, and still went sometimes in junior high. But I didn't join any school teams.","During my first two years in high school, I trained regularly in order to prepare for that special day. I had started practicing judo in the early grades of elementary school and would sometimes resume training during high school as well. However, I never joined any of the school’s sports teams."
"Whenever I had the time I'd jog around the school grounds, swim, or go to the local gym. The young trainers there gave me free lessons, showing me the best kind of stretching exercises and how to use the fitness machines to bulk up. They taught me which muscles you use every day and which ones can only be built up with machines, even the correct way to do a bench press.","Every time I had free time, I would go jogging on the school grounds, swim, or visit the local gym. The young trainers offered me free training sessions and taught me the best stretching exercises as well as the proper way to use weightlifting equipment to strengthen my body. They also explained to me which muscles are used in everyday activities and which ones can only be strengthened with the help of equipment, as well as the correct technique for exercises like bench presses."
"I'm pretty tall to begin with, and with all this exercise I've developed pretty broad shoulders and pecs. Most strangers would take me for seventeen. If I ran away looking my actual age, you can imagine all the problems that would cause.","I know I’m already quite tall, and thanks to all these exercises, I’ve developed quite a bit of muscle in my shoulders and chest. Most strangers would think I’m a 27-year-old guy. If I revealed my actual age, you can probably imagine the problems that could arise…"
"Other than the trainers at the gym and the housekeeper who comes to our house every other day--and of course the bare minimum required to get by at school--I barely talk to anyone. For a long time my father and I have avoided seeing each other. We live under the same roof, but our schedules are totally different.","Apart from the high school teachers, the cleaner who comes by twice a day, and the absolutely minimum amount of supplies necessary to keep things going at school, I hardly talk to anyone. My father and I have been trying for a long time to avoid each other. We live under the same roof, but our lives are completely different."
"He spends most of his time in his studio, far away, and I do my best to avoid him. The school I'm going to is a private junior high for kids who are upperclass, or at least rich. It's the kind of school where, unless you really blow it, you're automatically promoted to the high school on the same campus.","He spends most of his time in his studio—far from here—and I try my best to avoid him. The school where I teach is a private preparatory academy for children from wealthy families or, at least, from socially privileged backgrounds. It’s an institution where, as long as you don’t make any serious mistakes, you can automatically progress on to the higher education programs located on the same campus."
"All the students dress neatly, have nice straight teeth, and are boring as hell. Naturally I have zero friends. I've built a wall around me, never letting anybody inside and trying not to venture outside myself.","All the students dress neatly, have perfectly straight teeth… and they’re also extremely boring. Of course, I don’t have any friends. I’ve kind of built a “wall” around myself; I don’t let anyone in, and I try not to go out either."
"Who could like somebody like that? They all keep an eye on me, from a distance. They might hate me, or even be afraid of me, but I'm just glad they didn't bother me. Because I had tons of things to take care of, including spending a lot of my free time devouring books in the school library.","How could someone like me even be considered attractive? Everyone just looks at me from a distance. They might hate me, or maybe even be afraid of me… But I’m glad they didn’t bother me. I had so much to do; I spent a lot of my free time reading in the school library."
"I always paid close attention to what was said in class, though. Just like the boy named Crow suggested. The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn't going to be very useful in the real world, that's for sure.","Nevertheless, I always paid a lot of attention to what was being taught in class – just as the boy named Crow suggested. Facts, techniques, or any other things you learn in class are probably not very useful in the real world."
"Let's face it, teachers are basically a bunch of morons. But you've got to remember this: you're running away from home. You probably won't have any chance to go to school anymore, so like it or not you'd better absorb whatever you can while you've got the chance.","Let’s be honest: most teachers are nothing but a bunch of idiots. However, there’s one important thing to realize: you’re leaving your own home, and you’ll probably never have the chance to go back to school again. So, whether you like it or not, it’s better to remember as much as possible while you still have the opportunity."
"Become like a sheet of blotting paper and soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload. I did what he said, like I almost always do.","Let everything soak into you, just like a paper towel would… Later, you can decide what you want to keep and what you want to throw away. I did what he said… Just like almost always."
"My brain like a sponge, I focused on every word said in class and let it all sink in, figured out what it meant, and committed everything to memory. Thanks to this, I barely had to study outside of class, but always came out near the top on exams. My muscles were getting hard as steel, even as I grew more withdrawn and quiet.","My brain, like the tip of a soap bubble, absorbed every word that was spoken during the lessons. I tried to understand the meaning of these words thoroughly and to remember them. As a result, I hardly needed to study outside of class time and always achieved the highest grades on my exams. My muscles grew stronger, yet I became increasingly reserved and quiet."
"I tried hard to keep my emotions from showing so that no one--classmates and teachers alike--had a clue what I was thinking. Soon I'd be launched into the rough adult world, and I knew I'd have to be tougher than anybody if I wanted to survive. My eyes in the mirror are cold as a lizard's, my expression fixed and unreadable.","I knew I had to do my best to hide my emotions, so that no one—neither my classmates nor my teachers—could figure out what I was thinking. Soon I would be stepping into the difficult world of adults, and I knew I needed to be stronger than anyone else if I wanted to survive. My eyes in the mirror are as cold as those of a lizard; my face is stiff and unreadable."
"I can't remember the last time I laughed or even showed a hint of a smile to other people. Even to myself. I'm not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the time.","I can’t remember when I last laughed… Or even showed a slight smile to someone else, or even to myself. That’s not to say I can maintain this quiet, withdrawn attitude forever."
"Sometimes the wall I've erected around me comes crumbling down. It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what's going on, there I am--naked and defenseless and totally confused. At times like that I always feel an omen calling out to me, like a dark, omnipresent pool of water.","Sometimes the wall that I’ve built around myself collapses. It doesn’t happen very often, but occasionally I find myself naked, helpless, and completely lost. Before I even have time to understand what’s happening, I feel as if some kind of warnings are being sent to me… as if there’s a dark, omnipresent mass of water all around me."
"A dark, omnipresent pool of water. It was probably always there, hidden away somewhere. But when the time comes it silently rushes out, chilling every cell in your body.","A dark, omnipresent mass of water… It’s probably always existed, hidden somewhere. But when the right moment comes, it emerges silently, paralyzing every cell in your body."
"You drown in that cruel flood, gasping for breath. You cling to a vent near the ceiling, struggling, but the air you manage to breathe is dry and burns your throat. Water and thirst, cold and heat--these supposedly opposite elements combine to assault you.","They struggle to breathe as they are swept away by this brutal current. Clinging to a gap near the ceiling, they fight desperately… Yet the air they inhale is dry and burns their throats. Water, thirst, cold, heat—these seemingly contradictory elements combine to attack them from all sides."
"The world is a huge space, but the space that will take you in--and it doesn't have to be very big--is nowhere to be found. You seek a voice, but what do you get? Silence. You look for silence, but guess what? All you hear over and over and over is the voice of this omen.","The world is a vast universe… yet the place where you could perhaps be accepted (and which doesn’t even have to be very large) simply doesn’t exist. You search for a voice… but what do you get in return? Silence. You seek silence… but know this: all you hear, over and over again, is the voice of that terrible omen."
"And sometimes this prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep inside your brain. Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that rush of water.","Sometimes, this “prophetic” voice activates a “hidden switch” that lies deep within your brain. Your heart then becomes like a mighty river after a long rainstorm—flowing over the banks. All the “pathways” that were previously on the ground have disappeared, washed away by the rushing water."
"And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself: That's it. That's my heart.","Yet, rain still falls on the surface of the river. Every time you watch such floods on television, you think: “This is it… that’s how my heart feels too.”"
"Before running away from home I wash my hands and face, trim my nails, swab out my ears, and brush my teeth. I take my time, making sure my whole body's well scrubbed. Being really clean is sometimes the most important thing there is.","Before I leave home, I wash my hands and face, trim my nails, clean my ears, and brush my teeth. I take the time to make sure my entire body is properly cleaned. The feeling of being truly fresh can sometimes be the most important thing of all."
"I gaze carefully at my face in the mirror. Genes I'd gotten from my father and mother--not that I have any recollection of what she looked like--created this face. I can do my best to not let any emotions show, keep my eyes from revealing anything, bulk up my muscles, but there's not much I can do about my looks.","Every time I look closely at my own face in the mirror, I realize that the genes I inherited from my parents—even though I have no memories of what they looked like—have shaped this face. I try my best not to show any emotions, so that my eyes don’t reveal anything; I also work on strengthening my body… But as for my appearance, there’s hardly anything I can do about it."
"I'm stuck with my father's long, thick eyebrows and the deep lines between them. I could probably kill him if I wanted to--I'm sure strong enough--and I can erase my mother from my memory. But there's no way to erase the DNA they passed down to me.","I’ve inherited my father’s long, thin eyebrows, as well as the deep lines that run between them. Probably I could kill him if I wanted to; I’m sure I have the strength for it. Moreover, I could erase the image of my mother from my memory. But the DNA they gave me simply can’t be removed."
"If I wanted to drive that away I'd have to get rid of me. There's an omen contained in that. A mechanism buried inside of me.","If I want to remove him from my life, I have to destroy myself… There’s some kind of premonition behind that; a mechanism within me that makes it happen."
"A mechanism buried inside of you. I switch off the light and leave the bathroom. A heavy, damp stillness lies over the house.","A secret mechanism within you… I turn off the light and leave the bathroom. The entire house is filled with a heavy, damp silence."
"The whispers of people who don't exist, the breath of the dead. I look around, standing stock-still, and take a deep breath. The clock shows three p. m., the two hands cold and distant.","The whispering voices of people who don’t exist at all… The breath of the dead… I look around, don’t move, and take a deep breath. It’s 3 p.m.; the clock hands seem cold and out of reach…"
"They're pretending to be noncommittal, but I know they're not on my side. It's nearly time for me to say good-bye. I pick up my backpack and slip it over my shoulders.","They say they don’t take a clear stance on things, but I know they’re not on my side. It’s almost time to say goodbye. I pick up my backpack and throw it over my shoulder."
"I've carried it any number of times, but now it feels so much heavier. Shikoku, I decide. That's where I'll go.","I’ve already transported it a few times, but now it seems much heavier… Shikoku—make your choice. That’s where I’m going."
"There's no particular reason it has to be Shikoku, only that studying the map I got the feeling that's where I should head. The more I look at the map--actually every time I study it--the more I feel Shikoku tugging at me. It's far south of Tokyo, separated from the mainland by water, with a warm climate.","There isn’t any specific reason why Shikoku would be the right choice; the urge to go there just came to me when I saw the map. The more I look at the map—actually, every time I look at it—I feel that irresistible pull towards Shikoku growing stronger. Shikoku is located far to the south of Tokyo and is separated from the mainland by water; it enjoys a mild climate."
"I've never been there, have no friends or relatives there, so if somebody started looking for me--which I kind of doubt--Shikoku would be the last place they'd think of. I pick up the ticket I'd reserved at the counter and climb aboard the night bus. This is the cheapest way to get to Takamatsu--just a shade over ninety bucks.","I’ve never been there before; I don’t have any friends or family there. So if someone were to look for me (which would really surprise me), Shikoku would definitely be the last place they would think of. I pick up the ticket I reserved at the ticket office and then board the night train. It’s the cheapest way to get to Takamatsu—just over eighty dollars."
"Nobody pays me any attention, asks how old I am, or gives me a second look. The bus driver mechanically checks my ticket. Only a third of the seats are taken.","No one pays any attention to me; no one asks how old I am, and not even once does anyone give me a second glance. The bus driver mechanically checks my ticket. Only a third of the seats are occupied."
"Most passengers are traveling alone, like me, and the bus is strangely silent. It's a long trip to Takamatsu, ten hours according to the schedule, and we'll be arriving early in the morning. But I don't mind.","Most of the passengers are traveling alone, just like me, and strangely enough, the bus is very quiet. According to the schedule, the trip to Takamatsu takes ten hours, so we will arrive early in the morning. But that doesn’t bother me."
"I've got plenty of time. The bus pulls out of the station at eight, and I push my seat back. No sooner do I settle down than my consciousness, like a battery that's lost its charge, starts to fade away, and I fall asleep.","I have plenty of time. The bus leaves the station at eight o’clock; I lean back in my seat. As soon as I sit down, my consciousness—just like the battery of a device that has been charged—begins to fade away slowly, and I fall asleep."
"Sometime in the middle of the night a hard rain begins to fall. I wake up every once in a while, part the chintzy curtain at the window, and gaze out at the highway rushing by. Raindrops beat against the glass, blurring streetlights alongside the road that stretch off into the distance at identical intervals like they were set down to measure the earth.","In the middle of the night, it starts to rain—a heavy, relentless downpour. From time to time, I wake up, push aside the moldy curtains, and look outside. The streets blur by at high speed. Raindrops bounce off the windows, obscuring the streetlights installed along the way; those streetlights seem to stretch endlessly, as if they’ve been placed there specifically to “measure” the earth."
"A new light rushes up close and in an instant fades off behind us. I check my watch and see it's past midnight. Automatically shoved to the front, my fifteenth birthday makes its appearance. ""Hey, happy birthday,"" the boy named Crow says. ""Thanks,"" I reply.","Suddenly, a new light appears—then it quickly disappears behind us. I look at my watch; it’s already midnight. My fifteenth birthday has just passed… “Hey, happy birthday!” says the boy named Crow. “Thank you,” I reply."
"The omen is still with me, though, like a shadow. I check to make sure the wall around me is still in place. Then I close the curtain and fall back asleep.","But that ominous presence still lingers… like a shadow that follows me. I make sure the walls surrounding me are still in place, close the curtains, and then fall back asleep."

"Robert O'Connor: Setsuko Okamochi is an attractive, petite woman. Intelligent and responsible, she responded to the questions accurately and honestly. She still seems slightly in shock, though, from the incident.","Robert O’Connor: Setsuko Okamochi is a charming, petite woman. She is intelligent and responsible; she answered all the questions precisely and honestly. Yet, she still seems to be in the grip of the shock caused by that incident."
"As she searched her memory she grew very tense at times, and whenever this happened she had a tendency to speak more slowly. I think it must have been just after ten in the morning when I saw a silver light far up in the sky. A brilliant flash of silver.","As she searched through her memory, she became increasingly nervous; every time this happened, she also spoke more slowly. It was around ten in the morning when I saw a silver ray of light rising high into the sky—a brilliant, silvery glow."
"That's right, it was definitely light reflecting off something metal. That light moved very slowly in the sky from east to west. We all thought it had to be a B-29.","Exactly—that was undoubtedly light reflecting off a metallic object. The light moved very slowly through the air, from east to west. We all thought it was a B-29 bomber."
"It was directly above us, so to see it we had to look straight up. It was a clear blue sky, and the light was so bright all we could see was that silver, duralumin-like object. But we couldn't make out the shape, since it was too far up.","It was right above us; in order to see it, you had to look straight up. The sky was a bright blue color, and the light was so intense that we could only make out that silver object, which resembled duralumin. However, we couldn’t determine its exact shape because it was too far away."
"I assumed that they couldn't see us either, so we weren't afraid of being attacked or having bombs suddenly rain down on us. Dropping bombs in the mountains here would be pretty pointless anyway. I figured the plane was on its way to bomb some large city somewhere, or maybe on its way back from a raid.","I assumed that they couldn’t see us either; therefore, we didn’t have to worry about an attack or about bombs suddenly falling on us. Anyway, it would be pretty pointless to drop bombs in those mountains. I thought the plane was on its way to a big city to drop bombs there—or maybe it had just returned from a bombing mission."
"So we kept on walking. All I thought was how that light had a strange beauty to it. --According to military records no U.S. bombers or any other kind of aircraft were flying over that region at the time, that is, around ten a.m. on November 7, 1944. But I saw it clearly, and so did the sixteen children in my class.","So we continued on our way. All I could think about was the strange, yet breathtaking beauty of that light. According to military archives, at that time—around 10 a.m. on November 7, 1944—no American bombers or any other type of aircraft were flying in that area. Yet I saw that light very clearly, just as did the sixteen children in my class."
"All of us thought it had to be a B-29. We'd all seen many formations of B-29s, and those are the only kind of planes that could possibly fly that high. There was a small airbase in our prefecture, and I'd occasionally seen Japanese planes flying, but they were all small and could never fly as high as what I saw.","We all thought that it was almost certainly a B-29 aircraft. We had seen many formations of B-29s, and those are the only type of plane that can fly at such high altitudes. There was a small airbase in our area; occasionally we would see Japanese planes, but they were all very small and certainly couldn’t reach such great heights as the plane I observed."
"Besides, the way duralumin reflects light is different from other types of metal, and the only planes made out of that are B-29s. I did think it was a little strange, though, that it was a solo plane flying all by itself, not part of a formation. --Were you born in this region? No, I was born in Hiroshima. I got married in 1941, and that's when I came here.","Furthermore, the way in which duralumin reflects light is different from the way other metals do; the only aircraft made from this material are the B-29s. However, it seemed a bit strange that such an aircraft would fly alone, without being part of a formation… Are you from around here? No, I was born in Hiroshima. I married my wife in 1941 and then moved here."
"My husband was a music teacher in a junior high school in this prefecture. He was called up in 1943 and died fighting in Luzon in June of 1945. From what I heard later, he was guarding an ammunition dump just outside Manila when it was hit by American shells and blew up, killing him.","My husband was a music teacher at a high school in this prefecture. He was drafted in 1943 and died in June 1945 during the battle on Luzon. As far as I’ve later learned, he was overseeing an ammunition depot on the outskirts of Manila when he was hit by American grenades; the depot exploded, causing his immediate death."
"We have no children. --Speaking of children, how many were you in charge of on that outing? Sixteen all together, boys and girls. Two were out sick, but other than that it was the entire class. Eight boys and eight girls.","We don’t have any children. – But since we’re talking about children: How many children were in your care during this trip? There were a total of sixteen children, both boys and girls. Two of them were sick; besides those two, the entire class was part of the group: eight boys and eight girls."
"Five of them were children who'd been evacuated from Tokyo. We set out from the school at nine in the morning. It was a typical school outing, so everyone carried canteens and lunches with them.","Five of them were children who had been evacuated from Tokyo. We left the school at 9 a.m. It was a typical school trip, so everyone brought their lunch and a sandwich with them."
"We had nothing in particular we were planning to study; we were just going up into the hills to gather mushrooms and edible wild plants. The area around where we lived was farmland, so we weren't that badly off in terms of food--which isn't to say we had plenty to eat. There was a strict rationing system in place and most of us were hungry all the time.","We didn’t have any specific plans; we just went up the hills to collect frogs and edible wild plants. The area where we lived was mainly agricultural, so we didn’t lack food… although that didn’t mean we always had enough to eat. There was a strict rationing system in place, and most of us were constantly hungry."
"So the children were encouraged to hunt for food wherever they could find it. The country was at war, after all, and food took priority over studying. Everyone went on this kind of school outing--outdoor study sessions, as they were called.","Therefore, the children were encouraged to look for food in every possible place. After all, the country was at war; food was considered more important than education. Everyone participated in these school activities, which took the form of outdoor learning sessions."
"Since our school was surrounded by hills and woods, there were a lot of nice spots we used to go to. I think we were blessed in that sense. People in cities were all starving.","Since our school was surrounded by hills and forests, there were many beautiful places we could go to. I think we were lucky in that regard; after all, the people in the city were dying of hunger."
"Supply routes from Taiwan and the continent had been cut off by this time and urban areas were suffering terribly from a lack of food and fuel. --You mentioned that five of your pupils had been evacuated from Tokyo. Did they get along well with the local children? In my class at least they did. The environments the two groups grew up in, of course, were completely different--one way out in the country, the other in the heart of Tokyo.","The supply routes from Taiwan and the mainland had already been cut off by that time, so the urban areas were facing severe shortages of food and fuel. You mentioned that five of your students from Tokyo were evacuated; did they know each other well with the local children? At least that was the case in my class. The environments in which the two groups grew up were obviously very different—one group in the countryside, and the other right in the heart of Tokyo."
"They spoke differently, even dressed differently. Most of the local kids were from poor farming families, while the majority of the Tokyo children had fathers who worked for companies or in the civil service. So I couldn't say they really understood each other.","They spoke different languages and wore different clothes. Most of the local children came from poor farming families, while in Tokyo, most of the children had fathers who worked for companies or in the government. Therefore, it can’t be said that they really understood each other."
"Especially in the beginning you could sense some tension between the two groups. I'm not saying they bullied each other or got into fights, because they didn't. What I mean is one group didn't seem to understand what the other group was thinking.","Especially at the beginning, there was a certain degree of tension between the two groups. I’m not saying that they physically assaulted each other; that’s not what happened. What I mean is that one of the groups clearly didn’t understand what the other group was thinking."
"So they tended to keep to themselves, the local kids with other local kids, the Tokyo children in their own little group. This was only the first two months, though. After that they got along well.","So the local children tended to stick within their own groups; the children from Tokyo formed their own small community. However, this was only the case during the first two months; after that, they all got along very well with each other."
"You know how it is. When kids start playing together and get completely absorbed by whatever they're doing, they don't care about things like that anymore. --I'd like you to describe, in as much detail as you can, the spot where you took your class that day. It was a hill we often went to on outings.","You know exactly what I mean: once the kids start playing and get completely absorbed in what they’re doing, they stop paying attention to things like that. I would really appreciate it if you could describe in as much detail as possible where you took your class that day. It was a hill that we used to go to quite often during our outings."
"It was a round hill shaped like an upside-down bowl. We usually called it ""Owan yama."" [Note: ""Rice Bowl Hill.""] It was a short walk to the west of the school and wasn't steep at all, so anybody could climb it. At the children's pace it took somewhere around two hours to get to the top.","It was a round hill that looked a lot like an inverted scale. We usually called it “Owan yama.” It was located just a few steps to the west of the school, and it wasn’t steep at all; everyone could climb it. It took almost two hours to reach the top, depending on the speed of the children."
"Along the way they'd search the woods for mushrooms and we'd have a simple lunch. The children, naturally, enjoyed going on these outdoor sessions much more than staying in our classroom studying. The glittering airplane we saw way up in the sky reminded us for a moment of the war, but just for a short time, and we were all in a good mood.","During the walk, we looked for frogs in the forest and had a simple lunch. Of course, the children found these outdoor activities much more enjoyable than studying in class. The shiny airplane we saw high in the sky briefly reminded us of the war, but only for a very short moment; we were all in a good mood."
"There wasn't a cloud in the sky, no wind, and everything was quiet around us--all we could hear were birds chirping in the woods. The war seemed like something in a faraway land that had nothing to do with us. We sang songs as we hiked up the hill, sometimes imitating the birds we heard.","Not a single cloud was to be seen in the sky; not a breath of wind blew. Everything around us was utterly silent. The only sound we could hear was the chirping of the birds in the forest. The war seemed to belong to a distant land, having nothing to do with us. As we climbed the hill, we sang and occasionally imitated the sounds made by the birds."
"Except for the fact that the war was still going on, it was a perfect morning. --It was soon after you observed the airplane-like object that you went into the woods, correct? That's correct. I'd say it was less than five minutes later that we went into the woods. We left the main trail up the hill and went along a trampled-down path that went up the slope of the woods.","Besides the fact that the war was still ongoing, it was a perfect morning. Right after you saw that aircraft-like object, you headed towards the jungle, right? Yes, exactly. It took less than five minutes for us to enter the jungle. We left the main road that led to the hill and followed a narrow path that wound through the trees."
"It was pretty steep. After we'd hiked for about ten minutes we came to a clearing, a broad area as flat as a tabletop. Once we'd entered the woods it was completely still, and with the sun blocked out it was chilly, but when we stepped into that clearing it was like we were in a miniature town square, with the sky bright above us.","The slope was quite steep. After about ten minutes of walking, we reached an open area—a vast, completely flat plain. As soon as we entered the forest, it became utterly silent; since the sun was obscured by the trees, it was cold. When we left the open space, we felt as if we were standing in a small village square, under a clear, bright sky."
"My class often stopped by this spot whenever we climbed Owan yama. The place had a calming effect, and somehow made us all feel nice and cozy. We took a break once we reached this ""square,"" putting down our packs, and then the children went into the woods in groups of three or four in search of mushrooms.","Our class would often stop at this place when climbing Mount Owan-yama. The atmosphere there was relaxing; it made us all feel calm and peaceful. As soon as we reached this spot, we would take a break and put down our backpacks. Then the children would go into the forest in groups of three or four to look for frogs."
"I insisted that they never lose sight of one another. Before they set out, I gathered them all together and made sure they understood this. We knew the place well, but it was a woods, after all, and if any of them got separated and lost we'd have a hard time finding them.","I made sure to emphasize that they must never lose sight of each other. Before we left, I gathered them all together and made sure they understood this rule clearly. We were familiar with the area, but it was still a forest; if one of them got separated from the group, it would be very difficult to find them again."
"Still, you have to remember these are small children, and once they start hunting mushrooms they tend to forget this rule. So I always made sure that as I looked for mushrooms myself I kept an eye on them, and a running head count. It was about ten minutes or so after we began hunting mushrooms that the children started to collapse.","Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that these are very young children; as soon as they start looking for frogs, they tend to forget about this rule. That’s why I always watched them closely and recorded exactly how many frogs they had collected. About ten minutes after the frog-hunting activity began, the children started to get tired."
"When I first spotted a group of three of them collapsed on the ground I was sure they'd eaten poisonous mushrooms. There are a lot of highly toxic mushrooms around here, even ones that can be fatal. The local kids know which ones not to pick, but a few varieties are hard to distinguish.","The first time I saw three of them fall to the ground, I was certain they had eaten some poisonous mushrooms. There are many highly poisonous mushrooms in this area; some of them can even be fatal. The local children know which mushrooms they shouldn’t pick, but it’s difficult to distinguish between different species."
"That's why I always warned the children never to put any in their mouths until we got back to school and had an expert check them. But you can't always expect kids to listen, can you? I raced over to the spot and lifted up the children who'd fallen to the ground. Their bodies were limp, like rubber that's been left out in the sun.","That’s why I always warned the children in advance not to put such objects in their mouths before we returned to school, so that an expert could examine them. But you can’t always rely on the children to listen, can you? I ran over to them and helped those who had fallen to the ground. Their bodies were motionless, as if they were made of rubber that had been exposed to the sun."
"It was like carrying empty shells--the strength was completely drained from them. But they were breathing fine. Their pulses were normal, and none of them had a temperature.","It was as if they were carrying empty shells with them; all their energy had vanished. Nevertheless, they were breathing normally, their heart rates were stable, and none of them had a fever."
"They looked calm, not at all like they were in any pain. I ruled out things like bee stings or snakebites. The children were simply unconscious.","They seemed calm; there was no sign of pain at all. I speculated that the cause of their unconsciousness could be a stab from an animal or a bite from a snake. The children simply weren’t conscious."
"The strangest thing was their eyes. Their bodies were so limp it was like they were in a coma, yet their eyes were open as if they were looking at something. They'd blink every once in a while, so it wasn't like they were asleep.","The strangest thing about them was their eyes. Their bodies were so motionless that you would think they were in a coma; yet their eyes were open, as if they were looking at something. From time to time, they would blink—indicating that they weren’t asleep."
"And their eyes moved very slowly from side to side like they were scanning a distant horizon. Their eyes at least were conscious. But they weren't actually looking at anything, or at least nothing visible.","Her eyes moved very slowly from left to right, as if she were scanning a distant horizon. At least her eyes seemed to be functioning normally… But in reality, she couldn’t see anything—not anything that she could perceive with her sight."
"I waved my hand a few times in front of their faces, but got no reaction. I picked up each of the three children in turn, and they were all exactly the same. All of them were unconscious, their eyes slowly moving from side to side.","I waved my hand in front of their faces several times, but there was no reaction at all. One by one, I picked up each of the three children; they were all exactly the same. They were unconscious, and their eyes were moving back and forth slowly."
"It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen. --Describe the group that first collapsed. It was a group of girls. Three girls who were all good friends.","This was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen. Could you describe the group that collapsed first? It was a few girls—three very close friends."
"I called out their names and slapped them on the cheek, pretty hard, in fact, but there was no reaction. They didn't feel a thing. It was a strange feeling, like touching a void.","I called out their names and slapped them in the face—quite hard, actually—but there was no reaction at all. They didn’t feel anything at all. It was a strange feeling; it was as if I were trying to grasp something that was completely empty."
"My first thought was to send somebody running back to the school for help. There was no way I could carry three unconscious children down by myself. So I started looking for the fastest runner in the class, one of the boys.","My first idea was to send someone to get help from the school. It was impossible for me to transport the three unconscious children by myself. So I started looking for the fastest runner in the class… one of the boys."
"But when I stood up and looked around I saw that all the children had collapsed. All sixteen of them had fallen to the ground and lost consciousness. The only one still conscious and standing was me.","But when I stood up and looked around, I realized that all the children were unconscious. Twenty-seven of them had fallen to the ground and lost consciousness. The only person left who was still awake and standing was me."
"It was like... a battlefield. --Did you notice anything unusual at the scene? Any strange smell or sound-or a light? [Thinks about it for a while.] No, as I already said, it was very quiet and peaceful. No unusual sounds or light or smells. The only thing unusual was that every single pupil in my class had collapsed and was lying there unconscious.","It looked like a battlefield. Did you notice anything unusual at that place? A strange smell, a strange sound, or some kind of strange light? [Think for a moment.] No, as I already said, it was very quiet and peaceful there. There was no sound, no light, and no unusual smell. The only thing that was unusual was that all the students in my class were unconscious and lying on the ground."
"I felt utterly alone, like I was the last person alive on Earth. I can't describe that feeling of total loneliness. I just wanted to disappear into thin air and not think about anything.","I felt completely alone—as if I were the only surviving person on Earth. I can’t describe that feeling of utter loneliness… I just wanted to disappear and stop thinking about everything."
"Of course I couldn't do that--I had my duty as a teacher. I pulled myself together and raced down the slope as fast as my legs would carry me, to get help at the school. Chapter 3 It's nearly dawn when I wake up.","Of course, I shouldn’t have done that; I had my responsibilities as a teacher after all. I quickly recovered and ran down the hill as fast as I could to seek help from the school. Chapter 3: It’s almost morning when I wake up."
"I draw the curtain back and take a look. It must have just stopped raining, since everything is still wet and drippy. Clouds to the east are sharply etched against the sky, each one framed by light.","I pull the curtain aside and look outside. It must have just stopped raining; everything is still wet, and droplets are still falling. The clouds in the east are clearly different from the rest of the sky; each cloud is surrounded by a halo of light."
"The sky looks ominous one minute, inviting the next. It all depends on the angle. The bus plows down the highway at a set speed, the tires humming along, never getting any louder or softer.","The weather can seem threatening one moment and then pleasant and warm the next; it all depends on the perspective from which you view it. The bus travels at a constant speed on the highway, and the tires make a soft noise, never getting louder or softer."
"Same with the engine, its monotonous sound like a mortar smoothly grinding down time and the consciousness of the people on board. The other passengers are all sunk back in their seats, asleep, their curtains drawn tight. The driver and I are the only ones awake.","The same is true for the engine: the monotonous noise, similar to the clattering of a mortar that slowly destroys everything over time, has a profound effect on the consciousness of the people aboard. The other passengers are all curled up in their seats, asleep; their curtains are tightly drawn. The driver and I are the only ones awake."
"We're being carried, efficiently and numbly, toward our destination. Feeling thirsty, I take a bottle of mineral water from the pocket of my backpack and drink some of the lukewarm water. From the same pocket I pull out a box of soda crackers and munch a few, enjoying that familiar dry taste.","We were transported to our destination in an efficient, yet somewhat indifferent manner. Thirsty, I take out a bottle of mineral water from my backpack and drink some of it. From the same bag, I also pull out a box of salted crackers; I start nibbling on them. The familiar, slightly dry taste is very pleasant to me."
"According to my watch it's 4:32. I check the date and day of the week, just to be on the safe side. Thirteen hours since I left home.","According to my watch, it’s 4:32 p.m. Just to be sure, I also check the date and the day of the week. Thirteen hours have already passed since I left home."
"Time hasn't leaped ahead more than it should or done an unexpected about-face. It's still my birthday, still the first day of my brand-new life. I shut my eyes, open them again, again checking the time and date on my watch.","Time has passed incredibly quickly, and there hasn’t been any unexpected turns in the course of the day at all. It’s still my birthday—the first day of my completely new life. I close my eyes, then open them again to check the time and the date on my watch."
"Then I switch on the reading light, take out a paperback book, and start reading. Just after five, without warning, the bus pulls off the highway and comes to a stop in a corner of a roadside rest area. The front door of the bus opens with an airy hiss, lights blink on inside, and the bus driver makes a brief announcement. ""Good morning, everybody.","Then I turn on the reading light, take out a bound book, and start reading. Before five hours even pass, the bus leaves the highway without any prior warning and stops at a bus stop. The front door of the bus opens quietly; the interior is illuminated, and the driver gives a brief announcement: “Good morning everyone.”"
"Hope you had a good rest. We're on schedule and should arrive in our final stop at Takamatsu Station in about an hour. But we're stopping here for a twenty-minute break.","I hope you’re well-equipped. We’re strictly sticking to the schedule, and in about an hour, we should reach our final destination: Takamatsu Station. However, we’ll make a 20-minute stop here for a break."
"We'll be leaving again at five-thirty, so please be sure to be back on board by then."" The announcement wakes up most of the passengers, and they silently struggle to their feet, yawning as they stumble out of the bus. This is where people make themselves presentable before arriving in Takamatsu. I get off too, take a couple of deep breaths, and do some simple stretching exercises in the fresh morning air.","We will be leaving again at 17:30; please make sure to be on board by that time. This announcement wakes up most of the passengers. They get up slowly and sigh as they exit the bus. At this moment, they are preparing to look their best before arriving in Takamatsu. I also get off the bus, take a deep breath, and do some stretching in the fresh morning air."
"I walk over to the men's room and splash some water on my face. I'm wondering where the heck we are. I go outside and look around.","I go to the men’s restroom and spray some water on my face. I wonder where in the world we are. Then I walk outside again and look around."
"Nothing special, just the typical roadside scenery you find next to a highway. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but the shape of the hills and the color of the trees seem different from those back in Tokyo. I'm inside the cafeteria sipping a free cup of hot tea when this young girl comes over and plunks herself down on the plastic seat next to me.","Nothing special—just the usual types of landscape developments along the sides of roads, something you often see on highways. Maybe I’m just imagining things, but the shape of the hills and the color of the trees seem different from those in Tokyo. I’m sitting in the cafeteria, drinking a cup of hot tea (which is offered for free), when a young girl comes over and sits down on the plastic chair next to me."
"In her right hand she has a paper cup of hot coffee she bought from a vending machine, the steam rising up from it, and in her left hand she's holding a small container with sandwiches inside--another bit of vending-machine gourmet fare, by the looks of it. She's kind of funny looking. Her face is out of balance--broad forehead, button nose, freckled cheeks, and pointy ears.","In her right hand, she holds a paper cup of hot coffee purchased from an automatic coffee machine; steam is rising from it. In her left hand, she carries a small container with sandwiches, which seem to be another example of the snacks available from these machines. She looks quite funny: her face has somewhat disproportionate features—a broad forehead, a small nose, red spots on her cheeks, and sharp ears."
"A slammed-together, rough sort of face you can't ignore. Still, the whole package isn't so bad. For all I know maybe she's not so wild about her own looks, but she seems comfortable with who she is, and that's the important thing.","A rather “rough” face; with barely defined facial features, that makes it impossible to ignore… Yet, it’s not actually that bad at all. Who knows? Maybe she doesn’t care much about her appearance, but she seems to accept herself as she is—and that’s what really matters in the end."
"There's something childish about her that has a calming effect, at least on me. She isn't very tall, but has good-looking legs and a nice bust for such a slim body. Her thin metal earrings sparkle like duralumin.","There’s something youthful about her; it has a calming effect on me, at least. She’s not very tall, but she has beautiful legs, and for such a slender figure, she has a rather attractive chest. Her earrings, made of thin metal, shine like duralumin."
"She wears her dark brown, almost reddish dyed hair down to her shoulders, and has on a long-sleeved crewneck shirt with wide stripes. A small leather backpack hangs from one shoulder, and a light sweater's tied around her neck. A cream-colored miniskirt completes her outfit, with no stockings.","She wears her dark brown, almost red hair down to her shoulders. She’s dressed in a long-sleeved shirt with a short collar and wide stripes. A small leather handbag hangs from her shoulder, and a light-colored sweater surrounds her neck. Her outfit is completed by a cream-colored mini-skirt; she’s not wearing any stockings."
"She's evidently washed her face, since a few strands of hair, like the thin roots of a plant, are plastered to her broad forehead. Strangely enough, those loose strands of hair draw me to her. ""You were on the bus, weren't you?"" she asks me, her voice a little husky. ""Yeah, that's right."" She frowns as she takes a sip of the coffee. ""How old are you?"" ""Seventeen,"" I lie. ""So you're in high school."" I nod. ""Where're you headed?"" ""Takamatsu."" ""Same with me,"" she says. ""Are you visiting, or do you live there?"" ""Visiting,"" I reply. ""Me too. I have a friend there.","Of course she had washed her face; a few strands of hair, that looked like the fine roots of a plant, stuck to her broad forehead. Strangely enough, those hairs seem to be pulling me towards her. “You were on the bus, weren’t you?” she asks in a somewhat rough voice. “Yes, exactly,” I reply. She frowns and takes a sip of coffee. “How old are you?” “Seventeen,” I lie. “Then you’re in high school.” I nod. “Where are you going?” “To Takamatsu.” “Me too,” she says. “Are you just visiting, or do you live there?” “Just visiting,” I say. “Me too—I have a friend there.”"
"A girlfriend of mine. How about you?"" ""Relatives."" I see, her nod says. No more questions. ""I've got a younger brother the same age as you,"" she suddenly tells me, as if she'd just remembered. ""Things happened, and we haven't seen each other for a long time...","“I have a friend… And you?” “Mom and Dad.” I get it… The nod of her head is a clear sign that there are no more questions. “I have a younger brother… About your age,” she says suddenly, as if just remembering. “Some things happened, and we haven’t seen each other in a long time…”"
"You know something? You look a lot like that guy. Anybody ever tell you that?"" ""What guy?"" ""You know, the guy who sings in that band! As soon as I saw you in the bus I thought you looked like him, but I just can't come up with his name. I must have busted a hole in my brain trying to remember.","You know what? You look a lot like the guy from that band. Has anyone ever told you that? “Which guy?” “Well, the one who sings in the band! When I saw you on the bus, I immediately thought you looked like him… But I can’t remember his name anymore. It really took me a long time to recall it.”"
"That happens sometimes, right? It's on the tip of your tongue, but you just can't think of it. Hasn't anybody said that to you before--that you remind them of somebody?"" I shake my head. Nobody's ever said that to me.","Things like that happen sometimes, don’t they? The word’s on the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t remember it anymore. Has anyone ever told you that you look like someone else? I shake my head: No one has ever said that to me."
"She's still staring at me, eyes narrowed intently. ""What kind of person do you mean?"" I ask. ""A TV guy."" ""A guy who's on TV?"" ""Right,"" she says, picking up her ham sandwich and taking an uninspired bite, washing it down with a sip of coffee. ""A guy who sings in some band. Darn--I can't think of the band's name, either. This tall guy who has a Kansai accent.","She’s still looking at me, with her eyes squinted. “What kind of person do you mean?” I ask. “The kind that appears on TV.” “A singer in a band, right?” “Yes,” she replies. She picks up her ham sandwich, takes a bite without much interest, and then takes a sip of coffee to help swallow it down. “That tall guy with a Kansai accent… Oh no, I can’t even remember the name of the band anymore.”"
"You don't have any idea who I mean?"" ""Sorry, I don't watch TV."" The girl frowns and gives me a hard look. ""You don't watch at all?"" I shake my head silently. Wait a sec--should I nod or shake my head here? I go with the nod. ""Not very talkative, are you? One line at a time seems your style. Are you always so quiet?"" I blush.","“Do you even have any idea who I’m talking about?” “Sorry—I don’t watch TV.” The girl frowns and studies me carefully. “Do you really not watch anything at all?” I shake my head silently. For a moment… should I nod or shake my head? I decide to nod. “You’re quite reserved when it comes to talking, aren’t you? It seems like your style is to answer only once per question… Are you still as quiet now?” My cheeks turn red."
"I'm sort of a quiet type to begin with, but part of the reason I don't want to say much is that my voice hasn't changed completely. Most of the time I've got kind of a low voice, but all of a sudden it turns on me and lets out a squeak. So I try to keep whatever I say short and sweet. ""Anyway,"" she goes on, ""what I'm trying to say is you look a lot like that singer with the Kansai accent.","Actually, I’m more of the reserved type… But one of the reasons why I don’t want to say too much is that my voice hasn’t fully changed yet. Most of the time, my voice is quite deep; sometimes, though, it suddenly becomes high and shrill. That’s why I try to keep my statements short and not reveal too much. “Anyway,” she continues, “I just want to say that you really resemble the singer with a Kansai accent.”"
"Not that you have a Kansai accent or anything. It's just--I don't know, there's something about you that's a lot like him. He seems like a real nice guy, that's all."" Her smile steps offstage for a moment, then does an encore, all while I'm dealing with my blushing face. ""You'd resemble him even more if you changed your hair,"" she says. ""Let it grow out a little, use some gel to make it flip up a bit.","It’s not that you have a Kansai accent or anything like that… It’s just… I don’t know exactly what it is, but there’s something about you that makes you very similar to him. He really seems like a nice person, that’s all. Your smile fades for a moment, then comes back again; the whole time you’re trying to hide the blush on your face. “You’d look even more like him if you changed your hairstyle,” she says. “Let your hair grow a little longer and use some gel to curl it upwards.”"
"I'd love to give it a try. You'd definitely look good like that. Actually, I'm a hairdresser."" I nod and sip my tea.","I would really love to try that; with that hairstyle, you look absolutely stunning! In fact, I’m a barber myself. I nod and take a sip of tea."
"The cafeteria is dead silent. None of the usual background music, nobody else talking besides the two of us. ""Maybe you don't like talking?"" she says, resting her head in one hand and giving me a serious look. I shake my head. ""No, that's not it."" ""You think it's a pain to talk to people?"" One more shake of my head.","The cafeteria is enveloped in a dead silence. There’s no usual background music, and no one else is talking except for the two of us. “Maybe you just don’t like talking?” she asks, resting her head in her hands and looking at me seriously. I shake my head. “No, that’s not it.” “Do you think talking to people is difficult?” I shake my head again."
"She picks up her other sandwich with strawberry jam instead of ham, then frowns and gives me this look of disbelief. ""Would you eat this for me? I hate strawberry-jam sandwiches more than anything. Ever since I was a kid."" I take it from her. Strawberry-jam sandwiches aren't exactly on my top-ten list either, but I don't say a word and start eating.","She takes her other sandwich—the one without ham and instead filled with raspberry jam—and frowns. Then she looks at me in disbelief and says, “Would you really eat that for me? I hate raspberry jam sandwiches more than anything in this world… Since I was a little girl.” I take it from her hands. Raspberry jam sandwiches aren’t exactly my favorite either, but I don’t say anything and just start eating."
"From across the table she watches until I finish every last crumb. ""Could you do me a favor?"" she says. ""A favor?"" ""Can I sit next to you until we get to Takamatsu? I just can't relax when I sit by myself. I always feel like some weird person's going to plop himself down next to me, and then I can't get to sleep. When I bought my ticket they told me they were all single seats, but when I got on I saw they're all doubles.","Across from the table, she looks at me until I’ve finished eating the last crumb. “Could you do me a favor?” she asks. “A favor?” “Could I sit next to you on the train to Takamatsu?” She continues. “I really can’t relax when I’m by myself; I always feel like someone else is going to sit next to me, and then I can’t fall asleep. When I bought my ticket, they told me all the seats were ‘several-seater’ tickets, but only on the train did I realize they were actually double-seater seats.”"
"I just want to catch a few winks before we arrive, and you seem like a nice guy. Do you mind?"" ""No problem."" ""Thanks,"" she says. ""'In traveling, a companion,' as the saying goes."" I nod. Nod, nod, nod--that's all I seem capable of.","I just want to take a couple of short naps before I arrive. And you seem like a nice person… Would it bother you if I did that? “No problem at all,” he replied. “Thank you,” she said. “As the saying goes, ‘A good travel companion can be of great help during a journey.’” I just nod; that’s all I can manage to do…"
"But what should I say? ""How does that end?"" she asks. ""How does what end?"" ""After a companion, how does it go? I can't remember. I never was very good at Japanese."" ""'In life, compassion,'"" I say. ""'In traveling, a companion, in life, compassion,'"" she repeats, making sure of it. If she had paper and pencil, it wouldn't surprise me if she wrote it down. ""So what does that really mean? In simple terms."" I think it over.","But what exactly should I say? “How does all this end?” she asks. “How does what end?” “After you’ve had a travel guide… what happens after that? I can’t remember anymore… I was never very good at Japanese.” “Compassion is important in life,” I say. “You need a travel guide on your travels; you need compassion in life,” she repeats, to make sure she’s understood me correctly. If only she had paper and a pen; I wouldn’t be surprised if she took notes. “So, what does this all mean, in simple terms?” I think for a moment."
"It takes me a while to gather my thoughts, but she waits patiently. ""I think it means,"" I say, ""that chance encounters are what keep us going. In simple terms."" She mulls that over for a while, then slowly brings her hands together on top of the table and rests them there lightly. ""I think you're right about that-that chance encounters keep us going."" I glance at my watch. It's five-thirty already. ""Maybe we better be getting back."" ""Yeah, I guess so.","It takes a moment for me to sort out my thoughts, but she waits patiently. “I think what this means is that it’s those very random encounters that give us the strength to move forward,” I say. She thinks for a while, then slowly places her hands on the table. “I believe you’re right; those random encounters are indeed the driving force behind our progress,” she says. I look at my watch; it’s already half-six. “Maybe we should head back.” “Yes, that would be good.”"
"Let's go,"" she says, making no move, though, to get up. ""By the way, where are we?"" I ask. ""I have no idea,"" she says. She cranes her neck and sweeps the place with her eyes. Her earrings jiggle back and forth like two precarious pieces of ripe fruit ready to fall. ""From the time I'm guessing we're near Kurashiki, not that it matters.","“It can begin now,” she said, but she didn’t make any attempt to get up. “By the way: where are we?” I asked. “No idea,” she replied. She turned her head around and looked around; her earrings swayed back and forth, as if they were two ripe fruits about to fall off at any moment. “I think we should be somewhere near Kurashiki… But actually, it doesn’t really matter.”"
"A rest area on a highway is just a place you pass through. To get from here to there."" She holds up her right index finger and her left index finger, about twelve inches apart. ""What does it matter what it's called?"" she continues. ""You've got your restrooms and your food. Your fluorescent lights and your plastic chairs.","A rest stop on a highway is nothing more than a place you pass by on your way from point A to point B. “She holds her right and left index fingers out and separates them by about fifty centimeters,” she explains. “What does the name of that place matter?” she continues. “There are toilets, food, light bulbs, and plastic chairs…”"
"Crappy coffee. Strawberry-jam sandwiches. It's all pointless--assuming you try to find a point to it.","Coffee of poor quality, sandwiches with raspberry jam… That’s all just absurd. At least if you’re still trying to make any sense of the situation at that point."
"We're coming from somewhere, heading somewhere else. That's all you need to know, right?"" I nod. And nod.","We come from one place and go to another place. That’s all you need to know, right? I nod again."
"And nod. When we get back to the bus the other passengers are already aboard, with just us holding things up. The driver's a young guy with this intense look that reminds me of some stern watchman.","I know what you mean; I nod in agreement. As we walk back to the bus, the other passengers are already on board, and it’s just us who are delaying the departure. The driver is a young man with a piercing gaze; he makes me think of a strict supervisor or guardian."
"He turns a reproachful gaze on the two of us but doesn't say anything, and the girl shoots him an innocent sorry-we're-late smile. He reaches out to push a lever and the door hisses closed. The girl lugs her little suitcase over and sits down beside me--a nothing kind of suitcase she must've picked up at some discount place--and I pick it up for her and store it away in the overhead rack.","He throws us a reproachful look, but says nothing. The girl gives him an innocent smile, indicating that she regrets being late. He presses a button, and the door closes with a hissing sound. She pulls her small suitcase over to me and sits down next to me. It’s a fairly ordinary suitcase; she probably bought it at a discount store. I pick up the suitcase and place it on the rack above our heads."
"Pretty heavy for its size. She thanks me, then reclines her seat and fades off to sleep. Like it can barely wait to get going, the bus starts to roll the instant we get settled.","It’s definitely the hardest thing for her, considering her size… She thanks me, then sits down on her chair and falls asleep. It’s like she can’t wait to leave; the bus starts moving as soon as we’re all seated."
"I pull out my paperback and pick up where I'd left off. The girl's soon fast asleep, and as the bus sways through each curve her head leans against my shoulder, finally coming to a rest there. Mouth closed, she's breathing quietly through her nose, the breath grazing my shoulder at regular beats.","I take out the book bound in leather and continue reading where I left off. The girl falls asleep quickly; as the bus starts to move more, her head gradually leans more and more on my shoulder. She breathes softly through her nose with her lips closed, and her breaths regularly touch my shoulder."
"I look down and catch a glimpse of her bra strap through the collar of her crewneck shirt, a thin, cream-colored strap. I picture the delicate fabric at the end of that strap. The soft breasts beneath.","Every time I look down, I see the clasp of her bra through the neckline of her round-necked blouse—a thin, cream-colored clasp. I imagine how soft the material must be that holds the bra in place, and how lovely and enticing the breasts hidden beneath it must be."
"The pink nipples taut under my fingertips. Not that I'm trying to imagine all this, but I can't help it. And--no surprise--I get a massive hard-on.","The pinkish warmth stretches under my fingers. It’s not that I’m just imagining all this; yet I can’t do anything about it. And… that’s really not surprising at all, since I’m experiencing a strong erection."
"So rigid it makes me wonder how any part of your body could ever get so rock hard. Just then a thought hits me. Maybe--just maybe--this girl's my sister.","So stiff… I wonder how any part of your body can become that hard as stone. At that moment, an idea comes to my mind: Maybe… just maybe, this girl is my sister."
"She's about the right age. Her odd looks aren't at all like the girl in the photo, but you can't always count on that. Depending on how they're taken people sometimes look totally different.","She’s about the right age. Her somewhat unusual appearance has absolutely no resemblance to the woman in the photo—but you can’t always rely on that; depending on how the photos were taken, the people in them can look quite different."
"She said she has a brother my age who she hasn't seen in ages. Couldn't that brother be me--in theory, at least? I stare at her chest. As she breathes, the rounded peaks move up and down like the swell of waves, somehow reminding me of rain falling softly on a broad stretch of sea.","She said she had a brother my age that she hadn’t seen in a long time. Could it be me… at least in theory? I look at her breasts; with each breath they rise and fall, just like the waves on the surface of the sea. That suddenly reminds me of the sound of rain gently falling on the vast ocean valley."
"I'm the lonely voyager standing on deck, and she's the sea. The sky is a blanket of gray, merging with the gray sea off on the horizon. It's hard to tell the difference between sea and sky.","I am the lone traveler standing on the deck; she is the sea. The sky is a gray canvas that blends with the gray sea at the horizon. It’s difficult to distinguish between the sea and the sky."
"Between voyager and sea. Between reality and the workings of the heart. The girl wears two rings on her fingers, neither of which is a wedding or engagement ring, just cheap things you find at those little boutiques girls shop at.","Between the journey and the sea… Between reality and the secrets of the heart… The young girl wears two rings on her fingers; neither of them is a wedding ring or an engagement ring, but rather simple pieces of jewelry bought at those little shops that girls love to visit."
"Her fingers are long and thin but look strong, the nails are short and nicely trimmed with a light pink polish. Her hands are resting lightly on the knees thrust out from her miniskirt. I want to touch those hands, but of course I don't.","Her fingers are long and slender, yet they look very strong. Her nails are short, neatly trimmed, and painted a light pink. Her hands rest gently on her knees, which are peeking out from her mini-skirt. I have the urge to touch those hands… but of course, I don’t do it."
"Asleep, she looks like a young child. One pointy ear peeks out from the strands of hair like a little mushroom, looking strangely fragile. I shut my book and look for a while at the passing scenery.","She’s in a deep state of sleep; she looks like a little child. One of her sharp ears sticks out from her hair, resembling the stalk of a small mushroom, and the ear has a strange, fragile appearance. I close my book and take a moment to watch the landscapes pass by."
"But very soon, before I realize it, I fall asleep myself. Chapter 4 U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT Dated: May 12, 1946 Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944 Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-42216-WWN The following is a taped interview with Doctor Juichi Nakazawa (53), who ran an internal medicine clinic in [name deleted] Town at the time of the incident.","But very quickly—before I even realize it—I fall asleep as well.    **Chapter 4: Report from the U.S. Army’s Secret Service (MIS)**   **Date:** May 12, 1946   **Title:** Report on the Incident at Rice Bowl Hill (1944)   **Document Number:** PTYX-722-8936745-42216-WWN    This document contains a recorded interview with Dr. Juichi Nakazawa (53 years old), who was in charge of an internal medicine clinic in the city of [name missing] at the time of the incident."
"Materials related to the interview can be accessed using application number PTYX722-SQ-162 to 183. Impressions of the interviewer Lt. Robert O'Connor: Doctor Nakazawa is so big boned and dark skinned he looks more like a farm foreman than a doctor.","The documents pertaining to these interviews are available under the numbers PTYX722-SQ-162 to PTYX722-SQ-183. Comment from the interviewer, Lieutenant Robert O’Connor: Dr. Nakazawa has a very distinct bone structure and dark skin; he looks more like a farm supervisor than a doctor."
"He has a calm manner but is very brisk and concise and says exactly what's on his mind. Behind his glasses his eyes have a very sharp, alert look, and his memory seems reliable. That's correct--at eleven a.m. on November 7, 1944, I received a phone call from the assistant principal at the local elementary school.","His behavior is calm, but he is very direct and clear in his expressions; he says exactly what he thinks. Behind his glasses lies a lively and alert gaze, and his memory seems to be reliable. Exactly: on November 7, 1944, at 11:00 a.m., I received a call from the local deputy principal of the elementary school."
"I used to be the school doctor, or something close to it, so that's why they contacted me first. The assistant principal was terribly upset. He told me that an entire class had lost consciousness while on an outing in the hills to pick mushrooms.","I used to be the school doctor or something similar; that’s why they contacted me first. The vice principal was completely panicked. He told me that an entire class had lost consciousness during a field trip to the hills to collect frogs."
"According to him they were totally unconscious. Only the teacher in charge had remained conscious, and she'd run back to school for help just then. She was so flustered I couldn't grasp the whole situation, though one fact did come through loud and clear: sixteen children had collapsed in the woods.","According to his account, the children were completely unconscious. Only the teacher in question was awake; she had just arrived at the school to ask for help. She was so panicked that I couldn’t understand all the details of what happened. One thing was clear, however: sixteen children had fainted in the forest."
"The kids were out picking mushrooms, so of course my first thought was that they'd eaten some poisonous ones and been paralyzed. If that were the case it'd be difficult to treat.

My first thought was that they might have eaten some poisonous mushrooms and could now be paralyzed. If that’s the case, it would be very difficult to treat them.

However, there are also highly poisonous species of frogs; the venom could quickly enter the bloodstream, at which point it would be too late to take any action. Several people die here every year as a result of these deadly frog species."
